## Feature: Tooling API client cancels a long running operation

Add possibility to cancell execution of a long running operation using a `CancallableToken`. 
This `CancallableToken` is produced by `CancellableTokenSource` and can be used with several operations if needed.

    interface CancellationToken {
        boolean canBeCancelled();
        boolean isCancellationRequested();
    }

    public class CancellationTokenSource {
        public void cancel() ...
        public CancellationToken token() ...
    }

    interface LongRunningOperation {
        ...
        @Incubating
        LongRunningOperation withCancellationToken(CancellationToken cancellationToken);
    }


Note there there is an alternative proposal using a `Future` to perform cancellation differently:

    interface BuildFuture<T> extends Future<T> {
        void onSuccess(Action<? super T> action); // called immediately if the operation has completed successfully
        void onFailure(Action<? super GradleConnectionException> action); // called immediately if the operation has failed
        void onComplete(ResultHandler<? super T> handler); // called immediately if the operation has completed successfully
    }

    interface ModelBuilder<T> {
        BuildFuture<T> fetch(); // starts building the model, does not block
        ...
    }

    interface BuildLauncher {
        BuildFuture<Void> start(); // starts running the build, does not block
        ...
    }

    interface BuildActionExecuter<T> {
        BuildFuture<T> start(); // starts running the build, does not block
        ...
    }

    // TBD - fetch() should be called start() as well?
    BuildFuture<GradleProject> model = connection.model(GradleProject.class).fetch();
    model.cancel(true);

    BuildFuture<Void> build = connection.newBuild().forTasks('a').start();
    build.get();

    BuildFuture<CustomModel> action = connection.action(new MyAction()).start();
    CustomModel m = action.get();

### Story: Client uses internal API to request cancellation of long running operation

This story adds an API to allow a client to request the cancellation of a long running operation. For this story, the
API will be internal. The API will be made public in a later story.

#### Implementation plan

1. Add API to the client.
2. Add new tooling API protocol interfaces to support cancellation.
3. The provider implementation simply acknowledges the cancellation request, but does not actually cancel the operation. This is added in a
subsequent story.

#### Test cases

- Client can cancel operation for target Gradle version that supports cancellation:
    - Building model
    - Running tasks
    - Running build action
- Client receives reasonable error messages when attempting to cancel operation for target Gradle version that does not support cancellation.
- Client can cancel operation after operation has completed:
    - Successful operation
    - Failed operation

### Story: Daemon exits when operation is cancelled

This story adds a basic cancellation implementation. The behaviour is similar to the case where the command-line client is killed, where the daemon
process simply exits. This behaviour will be improved later.

#### Implementation plan

1. Provider implementation forwards the cancellation request to the daemon.
2. The daemon uses `DaemonStateControl.requestForcefulStop()` to terminate the build.
3. Forward a 'build cancelled' exception to the client.

#### Test cases

- Client cancels a long build
    - Some time after requesting, the client receives a 'build cancelled' exception and the daemon is no longer running.

### Story: Daemon waits short period of time for cancelled operation to complete

In this story, the daemon attempts to terminate a cancelled build more gracefully, by waiting for a short period of time for the build to complete.

#### Implementation plan

1. When `DaemonStateControl.requestForcefulStop()` is called, the daemon waits for 10 seconds (say) for the build to complete. If the build
completes, then do not exit. If the build does not complete in this time, exit the process.

#### Test cases

- Client cancels a short build
    - Some time after requesting, the client receives a 'build cancelled' exception and the daemon is still running.
    - Should use fixture to probe the daemon logs to determine that it has seen the request and terminated the build cleanly.
    - Client continues to get build output during this time.
- Command-line client runs a short build and is killed.
    - Some time after this the daemon finishes the build and continues to run.
    - Should use fixture to probe the daemon logs to determine that it has seen the event and terminated the build cleanly.
- Extend the existing daemon termination tests to use fixture to probe the daemon logs to determine that the daemon has decided to exit.

### Story: Task graph execution is aborted when operation is cancelled

In this story, task graph executor no longer starts executing new tasks when operation is cancelled.

### Story: Gradle distribution download is aborted when operation is cancelled

In this story, the Gradle distribution download is stopped when operation is cancelled.

### Story: Model configuration is aborted when operation is cancelled

In this story, no further projects are configured when operation is cancelled.

### Story: Build action receives exception when operation is cancelled

In this story, a `BuildAction` receives an exception when it is using or uses a method on `BuildController` when operation is cancelled.

### Story: Make cancellation API public

Add to public API and document.
