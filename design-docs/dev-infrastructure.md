Some ideas to improve feedback from the CI pipeline:

# Background

Here is a rough overview of the current structure of the CI pipeline

- Dev build: the build run by a developer prior to pushing changes
- Commit build: an initial verification stage early in the CI pipeline, triggered by each commit
- Coverage build: later stages of the CI pipeline. There are three kinds of coverage build:
    - Validate the entire Gradle product for some environment, such as Java 5 on Linux.
    - Validate the entire Gradle product in some execution mode, such as parallel or in the daemon.
    - Validate the entire Gradle product against the full range of supported versions of various integrations.
- Nightly build: later stages of the CI pipeline, triggered periodically, currently once per day.
    - Performance tests
    - Publish and smoke tests snapshots

This pipeline is replicated for the release and master branches.

# Reduce memory consumption of daemon processes started by test suite

- Verify that daemon processes are started with relatively small heap and permgen limits, rather than the defaults for the daemon, and fix if not.
- Kill daemons at the end of the build.

# Compile source against baseline Java version early in the pipeline

To fail early when later Java APIs are used.

# Automate installation of TeamCity agents on Windows build VM

- Ensure the init.gradle script is installed in the user's home dir.

# Split builds up so that each build covers a smaller slice of the source

Currently, most builds cover the entire Gradle code-base for a particular environment. We might split this up so that each build covers
only a slice through the Gradle code. This has some advantages:

- Different slices can be run in parallel by different agents
- When something fails due to some instability, less work needs to be performed when the pipeline is retriggered
- Provides somewhat finer-grained feedback

For example we might:

- Split core projects, such as core, coreImpl, launcher from the remaining projects.
- Trigger core projects only when the core source or build infrastructure changes.
- Trigger other projects when anything changes.
- Restructure the source layout to simplify this.
- Possibly for now keep the daemon and parallel tests as a single build, as this provides some useful stress. Replace this with real stress tests at some point.

# Run fewer multi-version tests in the earlier stages

There are several kinds of multi-version tests:

- `CrossVersionIntegrationSpec` subclasses that run against multiple older Gradle releases
- `MultiVersionIntegrationSpec` subclasses that run some integration against multiple versions of some external tool (eg multiple Groovy versions)
- `ToolingApiSpecification` subclasses that run against various combinations of current and older Gradle releases
- `AbstractInstalledToolChainIntegrationSpec` subclasses that run against the native toolchains that are available on the current machine

For example, we might

- change each of these to cover only a single version for dev and commit build (some of the above already do this, some don't)
- change each of these to cover only a single version for the environment coverage builds
- move coverage of the full set of versions to a nightly build

# Run some coverage builds less frequently

Possibly run these as nightly builds:

- Unknown OS coverage
- IBM JVM coverage

# Profile the commit and coverage builds

Investigate where the time is going and address this.

# Merge commits for coverage builds

Currently, coverage builds are triggered for each commit. We might change this so that multiple queued up commits are merged into a single build.

# Prioritise fast feedback over slow feedback

Tweak the teamcity settings so that:

- Release branch commit builds win over all master branch builds
- Commit builds for any branch win over all coverage builds for any branch
- Coverage builds for any branch win over nightly builds for any branch

Also remove the fast feedback agent pool

# Leverage incremental build

# Leverage parallel execution

# Install BarKeep code review tool

Set up [BarKeep](http://getbarkeep.org/) on `dev1` as an alternative to Crucible.

# Build machines provisioning

## Add monitoring to all build machines

- add New Relic monitoring to Linux machines without Salt
- add Nex Relic monitoring to Windows machines

## Extend Salt to not yet managed machines

Start with user management and installation of packages.
This applies to unmanaged machines running Linux and one Windows box.

## Use the same Linux distribution on all machines

Upgrade existing Saucy machines and probably also Precise.
