We would like to thank the following community members for their contributions to this release of Gradle:

Be sure to check out the [Public Roadmap](https://blog.gradle.org/roadmap-announcement) for insight into what's planned for future releases.

## Upgrade instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating your wrapper:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@`

See the [Gradle 8.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_8.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

For Java, Groovy, Kotlin, and Android compatibility, see the [full compatibility notes](userguide/compatibility.html).   

## New features and usability improvements

<!-- Do not add breaking changes or deprecations here! Add them to the upgrade guide instead. -->

### FILL-IN-KEY-AREA improvements

<<<FILL IN CONTEXT FOR KEY AREA>>>
Example:
> The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build performance by caching the result of
> the configuration phase. Using the configuration cache, Gradle can skip the configuration phase entirely when
> nothing that affects the build configuration has changed.

#### FILL-IN-FEATURE
> HIGHLIGHT the usecase or existing problem the feature solves
> EXPLAIN how the new release addresses that problem or use case
> PROVIDE a screenshot or snippet illustrating the new feature, if applicable
> LINK to the full documentation for more details

#### Ability to set conventions on file collections

Plugin-provided tasks often expose file collections that are meant to be customizable by build engineers (for instance, the classpath for the JavaCompile task).
Up until now, for plugin authors to define default values for file collections, they have had to resort to configuring those defaults as initial values.
Conventions provide a better model for that: plugin authors recommend default values via conventions, and users choose to accept, add on top, or completely 
replace them when defining their actual value.

This release introduces a  pair of [`convention(...)`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/file/ConfigurableFileCollection.html#convention-java.lang.Object...-) methods 
on `ConfigurableFileCollection` that define the default value of a file collection if no explicit value is previously set via `setFrom(...)` or `from(...)`.

```kotlin
val files = objects.fileCollection().convention("dir1")
files.from("dir2")

println(files.elements.get()) // [.../dir1, .../dir2]
```

`#from(...)` will honor the convention if one is configured when invoked, so the order of operations will matter. 

To forcefully override or prevent a convention (i.e., regardless of the order of those operations), one should use `#setFrom()` instead:

```kotlin
val files = objects.fileCollection().convention("dir1")
files.setFrom("dir2")


println(files.elements.get()) // [.../dir2]
```

This feature caters to plugin developers.
It is analogous to the [`convention(...)`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/provider/Property.html#convention-T-) methods that have been available on lazy properties since Gradle 5.1.

#### Improved error handling for toolchain resolvers

When attempting to download Java toolchains from the configured resolvers, errors will be better handled now, and all resolvers will be tried.

While mapping toolchain specs to download URLs, resolvers aren't supposed to throw exceptions. 
But it is possible for them to do that, and when it happens, Gradle should try to use other configured resolvers in their stead.
However, it wasn't the case before this fix.

Also, auto-provisioning can fail even after a successful toolchain spec to URL mapping (for example, during the actual download and validating of the toolchain)
In such a case, Gradle should retry the auto-provisioning process with other configured resolvers.
This was also not the case before the fix.
