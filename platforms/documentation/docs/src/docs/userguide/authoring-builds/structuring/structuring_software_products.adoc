= Structuring Software Projects Sample

This sample shows how to structure a software product that consists of multiple components as a set of connected Gradle builds.

It shows how Gradle is used to model a project's architecture.
This is reflected in the physical structure of the files that make up the software.

== Download the sample

The software product built in this sample is an application that displays link:https://gradle.org/releases/[Gradle Build Tool releases].

The application lists Gradle releases with links to release notes (_user_ feature) and offers an administration interface for the range of releases to be listed (_admin_ feature).

== The sample explained

As software projects grow, organizing large systems into connected components is common.
Typically, artifacts (such as source code) are organized in repositories and folder structures that reflect component boundaries and architecture.

Gradle can help organize and enforce boundaries between components.
To exemplify this, the sample project has the following architecture:

image::software_architecture.png[]

The structure follows commonly used software architectures.

At the bottom, we define our domain model.
There are two components:

1. a _domain-model_ component that contains the model definition (i.e., a set of data classes) and,
2. a _state_ component responsible for managing a modifiable state of the model during application runtime.

On top of the model, business logic for different (end-user) features is implemented independently.
We have two features:

1. _user_ and,
2. _admin_.

At the top, we have concrete applications users use to interact with the features.
We build a Spring Boot web application that supports both features.
And an Android app that only supports the _user feature_.

Our components rely on external components, the Spring Boot and Android frameworks, that are retrieved from binary repositories.

Apart from the production code, some components deal with building and delivering the product:

1. The _build-logic_ component contains the configuration details about building the software. +
It defines a Java version to use and configures the test framework. +
It also contains additional build logic in <<custom_plugins.adoc#custom_plugins,custom plugins>> with <<custom_tasks.adoc#custom_tasks,custom tasks>>.
2. The _platforms_ component is a central place to define which versions of external components are to be used in all of our own components. +
It defines the constraints for the environments – that is, _the platforms_ – to build, test, and run the software product.
3. The _aggregation_ component contains the setup of the delivery pipeline required to push the product to production and do automated end-to-end testing. +
This is the part of the build typically reserved for CI servers.

== The project structure

Let's look at the architecture of the sample.
Each _component_ is a separate _Gradle build_.
Each Gradle build has its own folder.

Since each folder is a separate build, each one has its own `settings.gradle(.kts)` file:

[source.multi-language-sample,kotlin]
----
├── android-app
│   └── settings.gradle.kts
├── server-application
│   └── settings.gradle.kts
│
├── admin-feature
│   └── settings.gradle.kts
├── user-feature
│   └── settings.gradle.kts
│
├── state
│   └── settings.gradle.kts
│
├── domain-model
│   └── settings.gradle.kts
│
├── build-logic
│   └── settings.gradle.kts
│
├── platforms
│   └── settings.gradle.kts
│
└── aggregation
    └── settings.gradle.kts
----

[source.multi-language-sample,groovy]
----
├── android-app
│   └── settings.gradle
├── server-application
│   └── settings.gradle
│
├── admin-feature
│   └── settings.gradle
├── user-feature
│   └── settings.gradle
│
├── state
│   └── settings.gradle
│
├── domain-model
│   └── settings.gradle
│
├── build-logic
│   └── settings.gradle
│
├── platforms
│   └── settings.gradle
│
└── aggregation
    └── settings.gradle
----

The components are arranged as a flat list in a root folder.
The root folder can be used as the root of a Git repository.

A build is added by using the `includeBuild()` construct in the root settings file:

====
include::sample[dir="samples/build-organization/structuring-software-projects/kotlin",files="settings.gradle.kts[tags=include]"]
include::sample[dir="samples/build-organization/structuring-software-projects/groovy",files="settings.gradle[tags=include]"]
====

== Component structure

A (sub)project is added using the `include()` construct in the settings file.

Let's zoom into the _domain-model_ component:

[source.multi-language-sample,kotlin]
----
└── domain-model              <-- component
    ├── settings.gradle.kts   <-- define inner structure of component and where to locate other components
    └── release               <-- (sub)project in component
        └── build.gradle.kts  <-- defines type of the project and its dependencies
----

[source.multi-language-sample,groovy]
----
└── domain-model              <-- component
    ├── settings.gradle       <-- define inner structure of component and where to locate other components
    └── release               <-- (sub)project in component
        └── build.gradle      <-- defines type of the project and its dependencies
----

When we look at the `domain-model` settings file, we see that `release` is included as a (sub)project:

====
include::sample[dir="samples/build-organization/structuring-software-projects/kotlin",files="domain-model/settings.gradle.kts[tags=include]"]
include::sample[dir="samples/build-organization/structuring-software-projects/groovy",files="domain-model/settings.gradle[tags=include]"]
====

== Assigning types to components

In Gradle, you assign a _type_ to a project by <<plugins.adoc#plugins,applying a plugin>>.

In the sample, the custom _type_ `com.example.kotlin-library` is applied to the `domain-model` component:
====
include::sample[dir="samples/build-organization/structuring-software-projects/kotlin",files="domain-model/release/build.gradle.kts[tags=project-type]"]
include::sample[dir="samples/build-organization/structuring-software-projects/groovy",files="domain-model/release/build.gradle[tags=project-type]"]
====

Note that `com.example.kotlin-library` is applied to several other components, including `state` and `admin-feature`.

== Using Convention plugins

Where does the `com.example.kotlin-library` plugin from?

It is defined in the `build-logic` component.

The `build-logic` component contains build configuration as Gradle plugins called _convention plugins_.
The `build-logic` component in the sample has several projects that each define a project _type_ through a _convention plugin_:

- `java-library`
- `kotlin-library`
- `spring-application`
- `android-application`

There is also a project called `commons` for build configuration shared by all the project _types_.

To apply a _convention plugin_ and assign a custom _type_ to a component:

====
include::sample[dir="samples/build-organization/structuring-software-projects/kotlin",files="build-logic/spring-boot-application/build.gradle.kts"]
include::sample[dir="samples/build-organization/structuring-software-projects/groovy",files="build-logic/spring-boot-application/build.gradle"]
====
<1> That it is of type `groovy-gradle-plugin` or `kotlin-dsl` to allow convention plugins written in the corresponding DSL
<2> It depends on our own `plugins-platform` from the `platforms` component
<3> It depends on the `commons` project from `build-logic` to have access to our own commons convention plugin
<4> It depends on the Spring Boot Gradle plugin from the Gradle Plugin Portal so that we may apply that plugin to our Spring Boot projects

Let's take a look at the code in `build-logic/spring-boot-application` where we define a custom project _type_ as a _convention plugin_:

====
include::sample[dir="samples/build-organization/structuring-software-projects/kotlin",files="build-logic/spring-boot-application/src/main/kotlin/com.example.spring-boot-application.gradle.kts"]
include::sample[dir="samples/build-organization/structuring-software-projects/groovy",files="build-logic/spring-boot-application/src/main/groovy/com.example.spring-boot-application.gradle"]
====

The `com.example.commons` plugin is applied, which is a convention plugin that configures the Java version and adds a dependency to a platform (`com.example.platform:product-platform` from the `platforms` component).
The spring boot plugin is applied.
Two dependencies that Spring Boot projects require are also added.

== Connecting components

The production code components depend on each other.

To make components (i.e., builds) known to each other, you use the `includeBuild` statement in the settings file.
This does not directly add a dependency between (projects of) components. It simply makes the physical location of one component known to another.

Consider the setup of the `server-application` component:
====
include::sample[dir="samples/build-organization/structuring-software-projects/kotlin",files="server-application/settings.gradle.kts"]
include::sample[dir="samples/build-organization/structuring-software-projects/groovy",files="server-application/settings.gradle"]
====

We see that the `settings.gradle(.kts)` file only defines the location for build logic components, other production code components, and the inner structure of the component.
We need the location of `build-logic` to apply the `com.example.spring-boot-application` to the `server application` component.

The `build.gradle(.kts)` file in the `server-application:app` project defines the actual dependencies by applying the `com.example.spring-boot-application` _convention plugin_ and utilizing the _dependencies_ block:
====
include::sample[dir="samples/build-organization/structuring-software-projects/kotlin",files="server-application/app/build.gradle.kts"]
include::sample[dir="samples/build-organization/structuring-software-projects/groovy",files="server-application/app/build.gradle"]
====

To declare dependencies between projects of components (i.e., subprojects in builds), you use the `dependencies { }` block of a `build.gradle(.kts)` file: `implementation("com.example.platform:product-platform")`.
If the included component provides a plugin, you <<plugins.adoc#sec:plugins_block,apply the plugin by ID>>: `plugins { id("com.example.java-library") }`
