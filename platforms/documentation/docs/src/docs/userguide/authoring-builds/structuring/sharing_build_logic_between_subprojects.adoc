= Sharing Build Logic between Subprojects

Subprojects in a multi-project build typically share some common _traits_.

image::structuring-builds-3.png[]

For example, several subprojects may contain _code_ in a particular programming language, while another subproject may be dedicated to _documentation_.
Code quality rules apply to all the _code_ subprojects but not the _documentation_ subproject.

While the subprojects may share common _traits_, they serve different purposes.
They produce different _artifact types_, for example:

- *public libraries* - libraries that are published to some repository
- *internal libraries* - libraries on which other subprojects depend
- *command line applications* - applications with specific packaging requirements
- *web services* - applications with specific packaging requirements

Additionally, some subprojects may be dedicated to *testing*.

The traits above identify a subproject's _type_.
In other words, a subproject's _type_ tells us what _traits_ the subproject has.

[[sec:convention_plugins]]
== Share logic using convention plugins

Gradle's recommended way of organizing build logic is to use its plugin system.

A plugin should define the _type_ of subproject.

In fact, <<plugin_reference#plugin_reference,Gradle core plugins>> are modeled the same way:

- The <<java_plugin#java_plugin,Java Plugin>> configures a generic `java` project.
- The <<java_library_plugin#java_library_plugin,Java Library Plugin>> internally applies the <<java_plugin#java_plugin,Java Plugin>> and configures aspects specific to a Java library.
- The <<application_plugin#application_plugin,Application Plugin>> applies and configures the <<java_plugin#java_plugin,Java Plugin>> and the <<distribution_plugin#distribution_plugin,Distribution Plugin>>.

You can compose custom build logic by applying and configuring both core and external plugins.
You can create custom plugins that define new project _types_ and configure conventions specific to your project or organization.

For each example _trait_ above, we can write a plugin that encapsulates the logic common to the subproject of a given _type_:

[[sec:using_buildsrc]]
== Share logic in `buildSrc`

We recommend putting source code and tests for the convention plugins in the `buildSrc` directory in the project's root:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/multiproject/dependencies-java/kotlin",files="settings.gradle.kts[];buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/myproject.java-conventions.gradle.kts[];api/build.gradle.kts[];shared/build.gradle.kts[];services/person-service/build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/multiproject/dependencies-java/groovy",files="settings.gradle[];buildSrc/src/main/groovy/myproject.java-conventions.gradle[];api/build.gradle[];shared/build.gradle[];services/person-service/build.gradle[]"]

Consult <<multi_project_builds.adoc#sec:multiproject_buildsrc,Using `buildSrc` for build logic>> to learn more.

[[sec:convention_plugins_vs_cross_configuration]]
== Do not use cross-project configuration

An improper way to share build logic between subprojects is _cross-project configuration_ via the link:{javadocPath}//org/gradle/api/Project.html#subprojects-groovy.lang.Closure-[`subprojects {}`] and link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/Project.html#allprojects-groovy.lang.Closure-[`allprojects {}`] DSL constructs.

TIP:  Avoid using `subprojects {}` and `allprojects {}`.

With cross-configuration, build logic can be injected into a subproject, and this is not obvious when looking at the subproject's build script, making it harder to understand the logic of a particular subproject.
In the long run, cross-configuration usually grows in complexity and becomes a burden.
Cross configuration can also introduce <<structuring_software_products_details.adoc#sec:decoupled_projects,configuration-time coupling between projects>>, which can prevent optimizations like
<<structuring_software_products_details.adoc#sec:configuration_on_demand,configuration-on-demand>> from working properly.

=== Convention plugins versus cross-configuration

The two most common uses of cross-configuration can be better modeled using convention plugins:

1. Applying plugins or other configuration to subprojects of a certain type. +
Often, the cross-configuration section will do `if subproject is of type X, then configure Y`.
This is equivalent to applying `X-conventions` plugin directly to a subproject.
2. Extracting information from subprojects of a certain type. +
This use case can be modeled using <<cross_project_publications.adoc#sec:simple-sharing-artifacts-between-projects,outgoing configuration variants>>.
