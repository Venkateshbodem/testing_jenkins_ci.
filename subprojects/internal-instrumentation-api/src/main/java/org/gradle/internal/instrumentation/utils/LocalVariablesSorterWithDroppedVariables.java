/**
 * This is a workaround for ASM {@link LocalVariablesSorter}'s issue with the scope of the variables introduced with {@link LocalVariablesSorter#newLocal(Type)}.
 * Those variables are added to all the method stack map frames following the creation of the variables. It may happen that there is a jump from an instructions
 * that is located earlier in the method to a frame that is visited after the variable has been created. In that case, the former frame will not have a variable
 * that will be assignable to the latter frame's variable, and that will result in a verification error.
 * <p>
 * This can be fixed by also tracking the variables that are out of scope and setting their type to {@link Opcodes#TOP} (meaning a variable that cannot be
 * used) in all frames that get visited after {@link LocalVariablesSorterWithDroppedVariables#dropLocal(int)} has been called.
 * <p>
 * A user of this class needs to also hold a reference to the original {@link MethodVisitor} and use that instead to visit the instructions
 * that operate with variables introduced with {@link LocalVariablesSorter#newLocal}.

// TODO: it should be possible to map the variables in a way that will not require using the original MethodVisitor to work with the introduced variables
//       (e.g. use negatives for new variables);
//       this could greatly simplify the use-site code but would require re-implementing LocalVariablesSorter from scratch.
