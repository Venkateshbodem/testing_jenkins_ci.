## Upgrade Instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle 5.3 RC1 by updating your wrapper properties:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=5.3-rc-1`

Standalone downloads are available at [gradle.org/release-candidate](https://gradle.org/release-candidate). 

## Feature variants (or optional dependencies)

Often a library needs to tell that some dependencies are only required if you use a specific feature of the library.
For example, you should only get the `mysql` dependencies if you actually plan to use MySQL.
Gradle now provides a powerful model for declaring those features a library provides, known as [feature variants](userguide/feature_variants.html):

A consumer which depends on this specific feature (MySQL) of your library would then just have to tell that it needs it:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // At compile time, we need the library
    implementation('org.gradle.demo:my-lib:1.0')
    
    runtimeOnly('org.gradle.demo:my-lib:1.0') {
        capabilities {
            // at runtime, we need the "MySQL" capability of this library
            requireCapability("org.gradle.demo:producer-mysql-support")
        }
    }
}
```

The library author can therefore model dependencies in "groups" that correspond to a feature:

```groovy
java {
   // declare an "optional feature"
   registerFeature("mysqlSupport") {
       usingSourceSet(sourceSets.main)
   }
}
dependencies {
   // declare dependencies specific to the "optional feature"
   mysqlSupportImplementation "mysql:mysql-connector-java:8.0.14"
}
```

Long story short, this can be used to model the long requested [optional dependencies](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/867)!
In practice, there are no optional dependencies: only dependencies that are _required_ if you use some features of a library.

## Kotlin DSL

### Kotlin 1.3.21

The embedded Kotlin version has been upgraded to Kotlin 1.3.21.

Please see the [Kotlin 1.3.21 announcement](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v1.3.21) for details.

### Type-safe accessors in precompiled script plugins

Starting with Gradle 5.3, Kotlin precompiled project script plugins now have type-safe accessors, just like regular project build scripts.

For example, here is how an hypothetical plugin that sets up a Java project according to some convention would be written as a Kotlin precompiled project script plugin in `buildSrc`:

```kotlin
// buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/my-java-convention.gradle.kts
plugins {
    `java-library`
    checkstyle
}

java {
    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
}

tasks {
    withType<JavaCompile> {
        options.isWarnings = true
    }
    checkstyleMain {
        maxWarnings = 0
    }
}

dependencies {
    testImplementation("junit:junit:4.12")
}
```

It makes use of type-safe accessors for the `java {}` extension, the `checkstyleMain` task and the `testImplementation` configuration, all contributed by the plugins it applies (`java-library` and `checkstyle`).

This plugin can then be applied to regular projects:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    `my-java-convention`
}
```

See the [Precompiled script plugins](userguide/kotlin_dsl.html#kotdsl:precompiled_plugins) section of the user manual for more information.

## Better help message on delete operation failure

The `clean` task, all `Delete` tasks, and `project.delete {}` operations now provide a better help message when failing to delete files. The most frequent and hard to troubleshoot causes for failing to delete files are other processes holding file descriptors open, and concurrent writes.

The help message now displays each failed path, which may be helpful in identifying which process might be holding files open, and will also display any files that were created in the target directory after a delete failure, which may be helpful in identifying when a process is still writing to the directory.

For example, a process holding `some.file` open in your `build` directory while running the `:clean` task would cause the following message to be displayed:

```
* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':clean'.
> Unable to delete directory '/path/to/your/gradle-project/build'
    Failed to delete some children. This might happen because a process has files open or has its working directory set in the target directory.
    - /path/to/your/gradle-build/subproject/build/some.file
```

A process still writing to your `build` directory while running the `:clean` task would display:

```
* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':clean'.
> Unable to delete directory '/path/to/your/gradle-project/build'
    New files were found. This might happen because a process is still writing to the target directory.
    - /path/to/your/gradle-build/subproject/build/new.file
```

## Improvements for plugin authors

### Public API for publishing custom components

Gradle now offers a public API to publish custom software components.
Refer to the [`SoftwareComponentFactory` documentation](javadoc/org/gradle/api/component/SoftwareComponentFactory.html) for details or look at the `JavaPlugin` and `JavaPlaftormPlugin` which have been migrated to use this API.

### Gradle Module Metadata 1.0

Gradle Module Metadata is now 1.0.

Gradle will automatically consume published Gradle Metadata, but to publish Gradle Metadata requires you to enable the `GRADLE_METADATA` feature preview.

### Factory method for creating `ConfigurableFileCollection` instances using `ObjectFactory`

Plugin and task implementations often need to create instances of various useful types, to provide a configurable model and DSL that is consistent with other Gradle plugins. One such type is `ConfigurableFileCollection`. In previous releases, plugins could use `Project.files()` or `ProjectLayout.configurableFiles()` to create instance of this type. However, these interfaces are not always available, for example in a `Settings` plugin (rather than a `Project` plugin) or in a nested model object.

In this release, plugin authors can use the `ObjectFactory.fileCollection()` method to create instances. The `ObjectFactory` service is used by plugin and task implementations to create objects of various useful types. This now includes instances of `ConfigurableFileCollection`.

## Default JaCoCo version upgraded to 0.8.3

[The JaCoCo plugin](userguide/jacoco_plugin.html) has been upgraded to use [JaCoCo version 0.8.3](http://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/changes.html) instead of 0.8.2 by default.

## Default Checkstyle version upgraded to 8.17

[The Checkstyle plugin](userguide/checkstyle_plugin.html) has been upgraded to use [Checkstyle version 8.17](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/releasenotes.html#Release_8.17) by default.

## Promoted features
Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User Manual section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

<!--
### Example promoted

## Fixed issues

## Known issues

Known issues are problems that were discovered post release that are directly related to changes made in this release.

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 6.0). See the User Manual section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](https://discuss.gradle.org).

### Incubating method `ProjectLayout.configurableFiles()` replaced by `ObjectFactory.fileCollection()`

The method `ProjectLayout.configurableFiles()` is now deprecated, and will be removed in Gradle 6.0. You should use `ObjectFactory.fileCollection()` instead.

### Breaking changes

<!-- summary and links -->

See the [Gradle 5.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_5.html#changes_5.3) to learn about breaking changes and considerations when upgrading to Gradle 5.3.

<!-- Do not add breaking changes here! Add them to the upgrade guide instead. -->
