### Task for enforcing JaCoCo code coverage metrics

Gradle introduces a feature for the JaCoCo plugin strongly requested by the community: enforcing code coverage metrics. The JaCoCo plugin now provides a new task of type `JaCoCoCoverageVerification` enabling the user to define and enforce violation rules. See the relevant user guide section on the “[JaCoCo plugin](userguide/jacoco_plugin.html#sec:jacoco_report_violation_rules)” for more information.
 
    tasks.withType(JaCoCoCoverageVerification) {
        violationRules {
            rule {
                limit {
                    minimum = 0.5
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
### Faster Java incremental compilation
    
The Java incremental compiler has been significantly improved. In particular, it's now capable of dealing with constants in a smarter way. It will avoid recompiling:

- if a constant is found in a dependency, but that constant isn't used in your code
- if a constant is changed in a dependency, but that constant wasn't used in your code
- if a change is made in a class containing a constant, but the value of the constant didn't change

For all those cases, the previous behavior was to recompile everything, because of the way the Java compiler inlines constants. The new incremental compiler will recompile only the small subset of potentially affected classes.
In addition, the incremental compiler is now backed by in-memory caches, avoiding a lot of disk I/O which slowed it down.

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 4.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](https://discuss.gradle.org).

## Potential breaking changes

### NO-SOURCE task outcome for tasks skipped due to empty inputs.

Tasks that have been skipped due to an empty list set of input files are now marked explicitly with `NO-SOURCE` in the console output instead of being marked with `UP-TO-DATE`. 
In the Tooling API progress listening, such tasks now emit a `TaskSkippedResult`, with `skipMessage = “NO-SOURCE”`. 
Running such tasks via `GradleRunner` using `TestKit` now results in `TaskOutcome.NO_SOURCE` and not `TaskOutcome.UP_TO_DATE`.
