## New and noteworthy

Here are the new features introduced in this Gradle release.

### CUnit integration (i)

The new Gradle `cunit` plugin provides support for compiling and executing CUnit tests in your native-binary project.

You simply need to include your CUnit test sources, and provide a hook for Gradle to register the suites and tests defined.

    #include <CUnit/Basic.h>
    #include "gradle_cunit_register.h"
    #include "operator_tests.h"

    void gradle_cunit_register() {
        CU_pSuite mySuite = CU_add_suite("operator tests", suite_init, suite_clean);
        CU_add_test(mySuite, "test plus", test_plus);
        CU_add_test(mySuite, "test minus", test_minus);
    }

Gradle will then generate the required boiler-plate CUnit code, build a test executable, and run your tests.

    > gradle -q runFailingOperatorsTest

    There were test failures:
      1. /home/user/gradle/samples/native-binaries/cunit/src/operatorsTest/cunit/test_plus.c:6  - plus(0, -2) == -2
      2. /home/user/gradle/samples/native-binaries/cunit/src/operatorsTest/cunit/test_plus.c:7  - plus(2, 2) == 4

    BUILD FAILED


See the [user guide chapter](docs/userguide/nativeBinaries.html#native_binaries:cunit) and the cunit sample (`samples/native-binaries/cunit`)
in the distribution to learn more. Expect deeper integration with CUnit (and other native testing tools) in the future.

### Component metadata rules can control whether a component version is considered changing

Component metadata rules can now control whether a component version is considered changing, or in other words, whether the contents
of one and the same component version may change over time. (A common example for a changing component version is a Maven snapshot dependency.)
This makes it possible to implement custom strategies for deciding if a component version is changing. In the following example, every
component version whose group is `my.company` and whose version number ends in `-dev` will be considered changing:

    dependencies {
        components {
            eachComponent { ComponentMetadataDetails details ->
                details.changing =
                    details.id.group == "my.company" &&
                        details.id.version.endsWith("-dev")
            }
        }
    }

This feature is especially useful when dealing with Ivy repositories, as it is a generalized form of Ivy's `changingPattern` concept.

### Tooling API exposes information on a project's publications

Tooling API clients can now get basic information on a project's publications:

    def projectConnection = ...
    def project = projectConnection.getModel(GradleProject)
    for (publication in project.publications) {
        println publication.id.group
        println publication.id.name
        println publication.id.version
    }

Both publications declared in the old (`artifacts` block, `Upload` task) and new (`publishing.publications` block) way are reflected in the result.

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 2.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](http://forums.gradle.org).

### Deprecations in Tooling API communication

* Using Tooling API to connect to provider using older distribution than Gradle 1.0-milestone-8 is now deprecated and scheduled for removal in version Gradle 2.0.
* Using Tooling API client version older than 1.2 to connect to a provider from current distribution is now deprecated and scheduled for removal in version Gradle 2.0.

## Potential breaking changes

### Changes to incubating native support

* '-Xlinker' is no longer automatically added to linker args for GCC or Clang. If you want to pass an argument directly to 'ld' you need to add this escape yourself.
