## New and noteworthy

Here are the new features introduced in this Gradle release.

### Dependency substitution rules

In previous Gradle versions you could use a 'Dependency resolve rule' to replace an external dependency with another:

    resolutionStrategy {
        eachDependency {
            if (it.requested.group == 'com.deprecated') {
                details.useTarget group: 'com.replacement.group', name: it.requested.module, version: it.requested.version
            }
        }
    }

This behaviour has been enhanced and extended, with the introduction of 'Dependency Substitution Rules'.
These rules allow an external dependency to be replaced with a project dependency, and vice-versa.

You replace a project dependency with an external dependency like this:

    resolutionStrategy {
        dependencySubstitution {
            withProject(":api") {
                useTarget group: "org.utils", name: "api", version: "1.3"
            }
        }
    }

And replace an external dependency with an project dependency like this:


    resolutionStrategy {
        dependencySubstitution {
            withModule("com.example:my-module") {
                useTarget project(":project1")
            }
        }
    }

There are other options available to match module and project dependencies:

    all { DependencySubstitution<ComponentSelector> details -> /* ... */ }
    eachModule() { ModuleDependencySubstitution details -> /* ... */ }
    withModule("com.example:my-module") { ModuleDependencySubstitution details -> /* ... */ }
    eachProject() { ProjectDependencySubstitution details -> /* ... */ }
    withProject(":api")) { ProjectDependencySubstitution details -> /* ... */ }

It is also possible to replace one project dependency with another, or one external dependency with another. (The latter provides the same functionality
as `eachDependency`).
Note that the `ModuleDependencySubstitution` has a convenience `useVersion()` method. For the other substitutions you should use `useTarget()`.

### Support for Precompiled Headers (i)

Precompiled headers are a performance optimization for native builds that allows commonly used headers to be compiled only once rather than for
each file that includes the headers.  Precompiled headers are now supported for C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ projects.

To use a precompiled header, a header file needs to defined containing all of the headers that should be precompiled.  This header file is
then declared in the build script as a precompiled header.

    model {
        components {
            hello(NativeLibrarySpec) {
                sources {
                    cpp {
                        preCompiledHeader "pch.h"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

Each source set can have a single precompiled header defined.  Any source file that includes this header file as the first header will
be compiled using the precompiled header.  Otherwise, the precompiled header will be ignored and the source file will be compiled in the
normal manner.  Please see the [userguide](userguide/nativeBinaries.html#native_binaries:preCompiledHeaders) for further information.

### Google Test support (i)

- TBD

### Continuous Mode (--watch)

As described in the [Gradle Roadmap](https://discuss.gradle.org/t/the-gradle-roadmap/105), we've been working on adding a 'continuous mode' for
Gradle builds. 

When you run with the `--watch` command line option, Gradle will not exit at the end of a build.  Instead, Gradle will wait for something to
change.  When changes are detected, Gradle will re-run the previous build with the same task selection.

For instance, if you run `gradle --watch build` in a typical Java project.  Main and test sources will be built and tests will be run. If
changes are made to the project's main sources, Gradle will rebuild the main Java sources and re-run the project's tests.  If changes are
made to the project's test sources, Gradle will only rebuild the test Java sources and re-run the project's tests.

If you run `gradle --watch assemble` in a typical Java project.  Only the main sources will be built.  Tests will not run. If changes are
made to the project's main sources, Gradle will rebuild the main Java sources.  If changes are made to the project's test sources, Gradle
will do nothing.

### Task group accessible from the Tooling API

Tasks in Gradle may define a _group_ attribute, but this group wasn't accessible from the Tooling API before. It is now possible to query the
group of a task through `org.gradle.tooling.model.Task#getGroup`.

### Progress events for build operations through the Tooling API

You can now listen to progress events for various build operations through `org.gradle.tooling.LongRunningOperation.addProgressListener(org.gradle.tooling.events.ProgressListener)`. You
will receive all available events as the Gradle build being executed goes through its life-cycle. For example, you will receive events when the
settings are being loaded, when the task graph is being populated, when the tasks are being executed, when each task is executed, when the tests
are executed, etc. All operations are part of a single-root hierarchy that can be traversed through the operation descriptors via `org.gradle.tooling.events.ProgressEvent#getDescriptor`
and `org.gradle.tooling.events.OperationDescriptor#getParent`.

If you are only interested in the progress events for a sub-set of all available operations, you can use
`org.gradle.tooling.LongRunningOperation.addProgressListener(org.gradle.tooling.events.ProgressListener, java.util.EnumSet<org.gradle.tooling.events.ProgressEventType>)`. For example, you
can configure to only receive events for the execution of task operations.

Progress events for more fine-grained operations will be added in future releases of Gradle.

### Increased visibility of components in model report

- TBD: Also means finer grained rules and improved performance (more efficient model implementation, rules, etc).

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

<!--

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 3.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](http://discuss.gradle.org).

### Changing a configuration after it has been resolved

TODO

### Distribution Plugin changes

Due to a bug in the distribution plugin (see GRADLE-3278), earlier Gradle versions didn't follow the general naming convention for the assemble task of the main distribution.
This has been fixed and assemble task name for the main distribution has changed from `assembleMainDist` to `assembleDist`.

### Deprecation of org.gradle.model.collection.CollectionBuilder

Use org.gradle.model.ModelMap instead.

## Potential breaking changes

### Configurations that are task inputs are resolved before building the task execution graph

### Changes in ComponentModelBasePlugin

#### Removal of `componentSpec` project extension

As part of work on exposing more of the component model to rules the `componentSpec` project extension previously added by all language plugins via `ComponentModelBasePlugin` has been removed.
Currently component container can be only accessed using model rules.

#### Changes in `ComponentSpecContainer`

- `ComponentSpecContainer` no longer implements `ExtensiblePolymorphicDomainObjectContainer<ComponentSpec>`.
- `ComponentSpecContainer` now implements `ModelMap<ComponentSpec>`.
- All configuration done using subject of type `ComponentSpecContainer` is now deferred. In earlier versions of Gradle it was eager.

### Changes in NativeBinariesTestPlugin

- `TestSuiteContainer` no longer implements `ExtensiblePolymorphicDomainObjectContainer<TestSuiteSpec>`.
- `TestSuiteContainer` now implements `ModelMap<TestSuiteSpec>`.
- All configuration done using subject of type `TestSuiteContainer` is now deferred. In earlier versions of Gradle it was eager.

### Source sets and binaries cannot be removed from components

### Type of binaries container of `ComponentSpec` has changed from `DomainObjectSet<BinarySpec>` to `NamedDomainObjectSet<BinarySpec>`

### Changes to `ComponentSpec`
- `getSource()` now returns a `ModelMap<LanguageSourceSet>` instead of `DomainObjectSet<LanguageSourceSet>`
- `sources()` now takes a `Action<? super ModelMap<LanguageSourceSet>>` instead of `Action<? super PolymorphicDomainObjectContainer<LanguageSourceSet>>`
- `getBinaries()` now returns a `ModelMap<BinarySpec>` instead of `NamedDomainObjectCollection<BinarySpec>`
- `binaries()` now takes a `Action<? super ModelMap<BinarySpec>>` instead of `Action<? super NamedDomainObjectCollection<BinarySpec>>`

### Changes to source sets container of `BinarySpec`
- `getSource()` now returns a `ModelMap<LanguageSourceSet>` instead of `DomainObjectSet<LanguageSourceSet>`
- `sources()` now takes a `Action<? super ModelMap<LanguageSourceSet>>` instead of `Action<? super PolymorphicDomainObjectContainer<LanguageSourceSet>>`

### Maven publishing

The [maven-publish](userguide/publishing_maven.html) and [maven](userguide/maven_plugin.html) plugins
no longer use the Maven 2 based [Maven ant tasks](https://maven.apache.org/ant-tasks/) libraries to publish artifacts.
Both plugins now use the newer Maven 3 `org.apache.maven` and Aether libraries.
Whilst the API's exposed by both plugins remain unchanged, the underlying publishing libraries have been upgraded.
