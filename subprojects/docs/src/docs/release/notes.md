## Upgrade Instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating your wrapper:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@`

See the [Gradle 6.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_6.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

For Java, Groovy, Kotlin and Android compatibility, see the [full compatibility notes](userguide/compatibility.html).

<!-- Do not add breaking changes or deprecations here! Add them to the upgrade guide instead. -->

## Dependency verification

Typical projects use a large number of external dependencies which put them at risk of using untrusted code.
What if you accidentally introduced malicious code via a transitive dependency?
Similarly, what if your build script itself is vulnerable to malicious code execution via a compromised plugin?

In an effort to mitigate the risks, Gradle 6.2 ships with [dependency verification](userguide/dependency_verification.html).
Dependency verification is a major step towards a safer ecosystem by making it possible to verify both the checksums and the signatures of dependencies and plugins used during a build.

By enabling dependency verification, Gradle will:

- make sure that the dependencies haven't been tampered with (by verifying their _checksums_)
- ensure the provenance of dependencies and plugins you use (by verifying their _signatures_)

and therefore dramatically reduce the risks of shipping malicious code to production.

With dependency verification, you maintain an XML file with checksums and optionally also signatures of all external artifacts used in your project, which includes, but is not limited to, all jars (binaries, sources, ...) and plugins.
Gradle will immediately fail the build if an artifact is not trusted or missing from the configuration file.

Please refer to the [userguide](userguide/dependency_verification.html) for a complete explanation about how to setup dependency verification. 

We would like to give special thanks to [Vladimir Sitnikov](https://github.com/vlsi) for his feedback and inspiration.
A lot of the work on this feature is, in particular, available to previous versions of Gradle via his [Checksum Dependency Plugin](https://github.com/vlsi/vlsi-release-plugins/tree/master/plugins/checksum-dependency-plugin).

## Shared dependency cache

Improving on [relocatable dependency caches introduced in the previous release](https://docs.gradle.org/6.1.1/release-notes.html#ephemeral-ci:-reuse-gradle's-dependency-cache), Gradle 6.2 now offers the ability to **share** a dependency cache between multiple instances.
In the context of ephemeral builds on disposable containers, this makes it possible to have a single, shared, directory between containers which contains most, if not all, the dependencies required by all builds:

- each container will have access to the shared read-only dependency cache, avoiding redundant downloads between builds
- this cache can be shared between containers without copying it, reducing the overall disk usage.

Please refer to the [userguide](userguide/dependency_resolution.html#sec:dependency_cache) to learn how to setup the shared dependency cache.

## Deprecation messages link to documentation

Deprecation messages now include links to relevant documentation that can provide more context around the deprecation and explain how to migrate to a new API or avoid the deprecated behavior. 

For example:
> The compile configuration has been deprecated for dependency declaration. This will fail with an error in Gradle 7.0. Please use the implementation configuration instead. Consult the upgrading guide for further information: [https://docs.gradle.org/6.2/userguide/upgrading_version_5.html#dependencies_should_no_longer_be_declared_using_the_compile_and_runtime_configurations](userguide/upgrading_version_5.html#dependencies_should_no_longer_be_declared_using_the_compile_and_runtime_configurations)

In some terminals, this link will be clickable and take you directly to the documentation.

## Promoted features
