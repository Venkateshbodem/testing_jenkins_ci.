## New and noteworthy

Here are the new features introduced in this Gradle release.

### Version Selection Rules (i)
Fine tuning the dependency resolution process is even more powerful now with the use of version selection rules.  These allow custom rules to be applied whenever
multiple versions of a module are being evaluated.  Using such rules, one can explicitly accept or reject a version or allow the default version matching
strategies to be applied.  This allows Gradle to customize version selection without knowing what versions might be available at build time.

    configurations {
        conf {
            resolutionStrategy {
                componentSelection {
                    // Accept the newest version that matches the dynamic selector
                    // but does not end with "-experimental".
                    all { ComponentSelection selection ->
                        if (selection.requested.group == 'org.sample'
                                && selection.requested.name == 'api'
                                && selection.candidate.version.endsWith('-experimental')) {
                            selection.reject()
                        }
                    }

                    // Rules can consider component metadata as well
                    // Accept the highest version with a branch of 'testing' or a status of 'milestone'
                    all { ComponentSelection selection, IvyModuleDescriptor descriptor, ComponentMetadata metadata ->
                        if (selection.requested.group == 'org.sample'
                                && selection.requested.name == 'api'
                                && (descriptor.branch == 'testing' || metadata.status == 'milestone')) {
                            selection.accept()
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        conf "org.sample:api:1.+"
    }

See the [userguide section](userguide/dependency_management.html#version_selection_rules) on version selection rules for further information.

### Native language cross-compilation improvements (i)

- Uses the file naming scheme of the target platform, rather than then host platform.
- Uses compiler and linker arguments based on the target platform, rather than the host platform.
- Added `eachPlatform()` method to each `ToolChain` type, to allow fine-grained customization of a particular tool chain on a per-platform basis.
- Added `TargetedPlatformToolChain.getPlatform()` to allow tool chain customization logic access to the target platform.

### Support for building x64 binaries on Windows using GCC (i)

Previous versions of Gradle have supported building x86 binaries using GCC on Windows. This Gradle release adds initial support for building
x64 binaries using GCC on Windows.

### Specify VCS integration with IDEA support

When using the `idea` plugin, it is now possible to specify the version control system to configure IDEA to use when importing the project.

    apply plugin: "idea"

    idea {
      project {
        vcs = "Git"
      }
    }

Note: This setting is only respected when the project is opened in IDEA using the `.ipr` (and associated) files generated by the `./gradlew idea` task.
It is not respected when the project is imported into IDEA using IDEA's import feature.

This feature was contributed by [Kallin Nagelberg](https://github.com/Kallin).

### Specify location of local maven repository independently

The location of the local Maven repository can now be controlled by setting the system property `maven.repo.local` to the absolute path to the repo.
This has been added for parity with Maven itself.
This can be used to isolate the maven local repository for a particular build, without changing the location of the `~/.m2/settings.xml` which may 
contain information to be shared by all builds.

This feature was contributed by [Christoph Gritschenberger](https://github.com/ChristophGr).

### Compatibility with OpenShift

The [OpenShift PaaS](https://www.openshift.com) environment uses a proprietary mechanism for discovering the binding address of the network interface.
Gradle requires this information for inter process communication.
Support has been added for this environment which now makes it possible to use Gradle with OpenShift.
  
This feature was contributed by [Colin Findlay](https://github.com/silver2k).

### Support for renaming imported Ant targets

When [importing an Ant build](userguide/ant.html#N11485) it is now possible to specify an alternative name for tasks that corresponds to the targets of the imported Ant build.
This can be used to resolve naming collisions between Ant targets and existing Gradle tasks (GRADLE-771).

To do so, supply a transformer to the [`ant.importBuild()`] method that supplies the alternative name.

    apply plugin: "java" // adds 'clean' task
    
    ant.importBuild("build.xml") {
        it == "clean" ? "ant-clean" : it
    }

The above example avoids a name collision with the clean task.
See the [section on importing Ant builds in the Gradle Userguide](userguide/ant.html#N11485) for more information.

This feature was contributed by [Paul Watson](https://github.com/w4tson).

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 3.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](http://forums.gradle.org).

## Potential breaking changes

### filesMatching used in CopySpec now matches against source path rather than destination path

In the example below, both `filesMatching` blocks will now match against the source path of the files under `from`. In
previous versions of Gradle, the second `filesMatching` block would match against the destination path that was set by
executing the first block.

    task copy(type: Copy) {
        from 'from'
        into 'dest'
        filesMatching ('**/*.txt') {
            path = path + '.template'
        }
        filesMatching ('**/*.template') { // will not match the files from the first block anymore
            path = path.replace('template', 'concrete')
        }
    }

### Native language support

- Replaced `TargetedPlatformToolChain` with `GccPlatformToolChain` and `VisualCppPlatformToolChain`.
- Renamed `PlatformConfigurableToolChain` to `GccCompatibleToolChain`.
- Removed tool properties from tool chains. `target()` or `eachPlatform()` should be used instead.

### Manually added AntTarget tasks no longer respect target dependencies

The `org.gradle.api.tasks.ant.AntTarget` task implementation adapts a target from an Ant build to a Gradle task 
and is used when Gradle [imports an Ant build](userguide/ant.html#N11485).

In previous Gradle versions, it was somewhat possible to manually add tasks of this type and wire them to Ant targets manually.
However, this was not recommended and can produce surprising and incorrect behaviour.
Instead, the `ant.importBuild()` method should be used to import Ant build and to run Ant targets.

As of Gradle 2.2, manually added `AntTarget` tasks no longer honor target dependencies.
Tasks created as a result of `ant.importBuild()` (i.e. the recommended practice) are unaffected and will continue to work.

### Sonar Runner Plugin

The sonar runner plugin now forks a new jvm to analyze the project. 
Projects using the `sonar runner plugin` should double check their memory settings for the Gradle build. 
Some large projects increased the memory settings for Gradle just to successfully run the sonar runner and avoid 
OutOfMemoryExceptions in the according task. The memory used for the sonar runner can now be set explicitly.
 
    sonarRunner {
         forkOptions {
             maxHeapSize = '1024m'
             jvmArgs '-XX:MaxPermSize=128m'
         }
    }
    
The default sonar runner version was updated to 2.3 which might cause trouble. The version is also configurable from now on.
    
    sonarRunner {
        toolVersion = '2.4'
    }
