### Faster Gradle builds
Gradle is now faster than ever.  A number of performance improvements targeted at "execution time" (i.e. the part of the build lifecycle
where Gradle is actually performing the actions of the build) have been introduced with this release:

* Messages are logged to the console more efficiently.
* A performance bottleneck when reading `gradle.properties` has been fixed.
* Compiled build scripts are cached more efficiently.
* Logging between the client and daemon now occurs asynchronously.
* Test report generation is more efficient.

TODO: Add more numbers here?
Stress tests run as part of Gradle's own build pipeline have demonstrated up to a 10% improvement in build time.

No change is required to builds to leverage these performance improvements.

### More convenient testing of Gradle plugins

Gradle 2.6 introduced the “[Gradle TestKit](userguide/test_kit.html)” which made it easier to thoroughly test Gradle plugins.
The TestKit has improved and matured with subsequent Gradle releases.

Starting with Gradle 2.13, less manual build configuration is required in order to make your plugin implementation available to test builds.
The [Java Gradle Plugin Development Plugin](userguide/javaGradle_plugin.html) now integrates with the TestKit by making the plugin under test's implementation classpath discoverable at test time.

See the [TestKit chapter in the Gradle User Guide](userguide/test_kit.html#sub:test-kit-automatic-classpath-injection) for more about this new feature.

### Customizing the HTML reports of Checkstyle and FindBugs

The HTML reports generated by the Checkstyle and FindBugs plugins can now be customized with local XSLT stylesheets.
See the documentation for the [Checkstyle](userguide/checkstyle_plugin.html) and [FindBugs](userguide/findbugs_plugin.html)
plugins for more details. Note that sample stylesheets for both plugins are available at:

- Checkstyle: [https://github.com/checkstyle/contribution/tree/master/xsl](https://github.com/checkstyle/contribution/tree/master/xsl)
- Findbugs: [https://github.com/findbugsproject/findbugs/tree/master/findbugs/src/xsl](https://github.com/findbugsproject/findbugs/tree/master/findbugs/src/xsl)

### Support for Groovydoc's noTimestamp and noVersionStamp flags

Groovy 2.4.6 adds two new flags to its Groovydoc command.
Using these flags produce Groovydoc HTML pages without timestamp or Groovy version stamp information embedded within them.
This means that it is harder to determine when or which version of Groovy produced the pages but means the pages remain totally unchanged across builds unless the actual content changes.

Two properties are added and can be used as follows.

    groovydoc {
        noTimestamp = true
        noVersionStamp = true
    }

The flags are ignored for versions of Groovy prior to 2.4.6.

### Signing with OpenPGP subkeys

OpenPGP supports subkeys, which are like the normal keys, except they're bound to a master key pair.
One useful consequence of OpenPGP subkeys is that they can be easily revoked independently of the master keys what makes key management easier.
Another consequence is that you only need the subkey for signature operations. In other words you can deploy only your signing subkey to e.g. a CI server.

A simple limitation in the signing plugin prevented to use subkeys, starting with Gradle 2.13, they are supported out of the box.
See the documentation for the [Signing](userguide/signing_plugin.html) plugin for more details.

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 3.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](http://discuss.gradle.org).

## Potential breaking changes

<!--
### Example breaking change
-->

### Deleting no longer follows symlinks.

The Delete task will no longer follow symlinks by default and project.delete() will not follow symlinks at all. Previous versions of Gradle would follow-symlinks during deletions. If you need the Delete
task to follow symlinks set `followSymlinks = true`. If you need `project.delete()` to follow symlinks, replace it with `ant.delete()`. This was done to prevent issues where Gradle would attempt to delete files
outside of Gradle's build directory (e.g. NPM installed in a user-writeable location.).

### Project Dependencies now include classifiers and all artifacts in generated POM files

Previously, dependencies between projects in a multi-project gradle build, would not respect classifiers when generating `pom` files for publishing to maven
repositories. It is possible that this caused gradle users to create workarounds and post-processing of `pom` files before archiving them. If the `pom` files
generated by this release of Gradle for your project are broken compared to previous releases this is probably why.

The best way to understand what is changed is through an example.  Suppose you have two projects in your build `project1` depends on `project2` in the `compile`
configuration, and `project2` provides three jars (the default jar requires no specification) in that same configuration.

    allprojects {
        group = 'org.gradle.test'
        version = 1.9
    }

    subprojects {
        apply plugin: 'java'
        apply plugin: 'maven'

        uploadArchives {
            repositories {
                mavenDeployer {
	                repository(url: "file:///$rootProject.projectDir/maven-repo")
                }
            }
        }
    }

    project(':project1') {
        dependencies {
            compile project(':project2')
        }
    }

    project(':project2') {
        task sourcesJar(type: Jar, dependsOn: classes) {
            classifier = 'sources'
            from sourceSets.main.allSource
        }

        task javadocJar(type: Jar, dependsOn: javadoc) {
            classifier = 'javadoc'
            from javadoc.destinationDir
        }

        artifacts {
            compile  sourcesJar
            archives sourcesJar
            compile  javadocJar
            archives javadocJar
        }
    }

In the previous version of Gradle, the resulting `project1-1.9.pom` would have included this dependency:

    ...
    <dependencies>
     <dependency>
        <groupId>org.gradle.test</groupId>
        <artifactId>project2</artifactId>
        <version>1.9</version>
        <scope>compile</scope>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ...

In this version of Gradle, the resulting `project-1.9.pom` will include the following dependencies:

    ...
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.gradle.test</groupId>
        <artifactId>project2</artifactId>
        <version>1.9</version>
        <scope>compile</scope>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.gradle.test</groupId>
        <artifactId>project2</artifactId>
        <version>1.9</version>
        <classifier>sources</classifier>
        <scope>compile</scope>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.gradle.test</groupId>
        <artifactId>project2</artifactId>
        <version>1.9</version>
        <classifier>javadoc</classifier>
        <scope>compile</scope>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ...

This improved behavior may mean you no longer need workarounds in your build scripts, but you might have to change those same build scripts so that the existing workarounds don't break the `pom`

### Task input properties names now follow the JavaBean specification

Task input properties now follow the JavaBean specification and thus are on par with Groovy. This means that:

- Input properties are now addressed with coherent names in validation error messages, the DSL and through `task.getInputs().getProperties()`.
- Input properties with getters like `getCFlags()` are now addressable through `task.getInputs().getProperties()` via `CFlags` instead of the erroneous `cFlags`.
- Input properties with getters like `getURL()` are now addressable through `task.getInputs().getProperties()` via `URL` instead of the erroneous `uRL`.

### Gradle implementation dependencies are not visible to plugins at development time

Implementing a Gradle plugin requires the declaration of `gradleApi()` 
to the `compile` configuration. The resolved dependency encompasses the 
entire Gradle runtime including Gradle's third party dependencies 
(e.g. Guava). Any third party dependencies declared by the plugin might
conflict with the ones pulled in by the `gradleApi()` declaration. Gradle
does not apply conflict resolution. As a result The user will end up with 
two addressable copies of a dependency on the compile classpath and in
 the test runtime classpath.
 
In previous versions of Gradle the dependency `gradleTestKit()`, which 
relies on a Gradle runtime, attempts to address this problem via class
relocation. The use of `gradleApi()` and `gradleTestKit()` together 
became unreliable as classes of duplicate name but of different content
were added to the classpath.
 
With this version of Gradle proper class relocation has been implemented
 across the dependencies `gradleApi()`, `gradleTestKit()` and the published
 Tooling API JAR. Projects using any of those dependencies will not
 conflict anymore with classes from third party dependencies used by
 the Gradle runtime.
