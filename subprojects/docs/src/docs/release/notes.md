Gradle 2.0 is an important milestone in the evolution of Gradle. 
As explained in the [Gradle 2.0 announcement](http://forums.gradle.org/gradle/topics/after_1_12_comes_2_0), the change in major version number signals a new backwards compatibility baseline.
Many deprecated features and API have been removed in this release, allowing the development team to simplify the codebase and implement new functionality. 
The “Potential Breaking Changes” section of these release notes list all of the breaking changes that have been made and all Gradle users are strongly encouraged to read the list.

Gradle has matured considerably in the evolution from 1.0 to 2.0.
It is more performant and is more memory efficient, particularly for large builds.
Performance optimization is a persistent area of investment and work, with further optimizations to come during the 2.x stream.
Performance, in all aspects, is critically important to a build system. 

In addition to the breaking changes, it's business as usual with the steady evolution of Gradle via new and refined API and features.

The move to Groovy 2.3.2 from Groovy 1.8 brings with it all of the new features added to Groovy in this time.
There is now a public API for resolving “source” and “javadoc” JARs for JVM library components.
The exposing of Ivy “Extra Info” attributes enables a new class of advanced dependency management use cases.
It is now possible to use the SFTP protocol for dependency consumption without using custom Ivy resolvers.
Maven POM profile support has also been improved through support for profile activation through absence of a system property.
There are also other refinements and improvements detailed below, including improvements to Gradle's support for building native projects.

We hope you enjoy Gradle 2.0 and the coming releases in the 2.x stream.

## New and noteworthy

Here are the new features introduced in this Gradle release.

### Updated to Groovy 2.3.2

Gradle now uses Groovy 2.3.2 to compile and run build scripts and plugins.
Gradle 1.12 (the last release in the Gradle 1.x stream) used Groovy 1.8.6.
This means that build scripts, and plugins/tasks implemented in Groovy can now use the latest Groovy features.

For information on what's new in Groovy, please check the [Groovy project site](http://groovy.codehaus.org).

### Support for Java 8

Running Gradle with Java 8 is now tested for and supported.
Java 8 is a substantial update with many substantial changes, as such some tools used by your builds may not be fully compatible yet.
For example, Scala's support for Java 8 is still experimental.

A regression within the Java 8 JRE has been identified that causes Gradle to appear to hang for a short amount of time at the end of a non-daemon build on Mac OS X and Linux.
Windows users, and users using the [Gradle Daemon](http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html) are unaffected.
The Java 8 team are aware of this issue and it will be addressed a future release of Java 8.

In order to support executing Gradle with Java 8, support for Java 1.5 had to be removed.
For more on the detail of why this was necessary, please see [this forum post](http://forums.gradle.org/gradle/topics/gradle_2_0_will_drop_support_for_java_5_and_will_fully_support_java_8).

### New API for resolving source and javadoc artifacts (i)

Gradle 2.0 introduces a new, incubating, API for resolving component artifacts. 
With this addition, Gradle now offers separate dedicated APIs for resolving components and artifacts. 
The entry point to the new 'artifact query' API is `dependencies.createArtifactResolutionQuery()`.

Presently, this feature is limited to the resolution of `SourcesArtifact` and `JavadocArtifact` artifacts for `JvmLibrary` components.
Over time this will be expanded to allow querying of other component and artifact types.

For example, to get the source artifacts for all 'compile' dependencies:

    task resolveSources << {
        def componentIds = configurations.compile.incoming.resolutionResult.allDependencies.collect { it.selected.id }

        def result = dependencies.createArtifactResolutionQuery()
                          .forComponents(componentIds)
                          .withArtifacts(JvmLibrary, SourcesArtifact, JavadocArtifact)
                          .execute()

        for (component in result.resolvedComponents) {
            component.getArtifacts(SourcesArtifact).each { println "Source artifact for ${component.id}: ${it.file}" }
        }
    }


For an example usage of the new API, see <a href="dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.query.ArtifactResolutionQuery.html">the DSL Reference</a>.

### Access Ivy extra info from component metadata rules (i)

It's now possible to access Ivy extra info from [component metadata rules](dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.ComponentMetadataHandler.html). 
Roughly speaking, Ivy extra info is a set of user-defined key-value pairs published in the Ivy module descriptor. 
Rules wishing to access the extra info need to specify a parameter of type [`IvyModuleMetadata`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/artifacts/IvyModuleMetadata.html). 

Here is an example:

    dependencies {
      components {
        eachComponent { component, IvyModuleMetadata ivyMetadata ->
          def deprecated = ivyMetadata.extraInfo["deprecated"]?.asBoolean()
          if (deprecated) {
            throw new GradleException("Component $component is deprecated. This project can not use deprecated components")
          }
        }
      }
    }

### Collaborate with plugins via `plugins.withId()` (i)

It is common to the need to perform some configuration only if a particular plugin has been applied.
The standard approach for doing this to date has been to use the [`plugins.withType(Class)`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/plugins/PluginCollection.html#withType\(java.lang.Class\)) method, 
which requires the class object of the implementing plugin…

    import com.my.custom.InterestingPlugin
    
    plugins.withType(InterestingPlugin) { 
      // perform some configuration after the “interesting” plugin has been applied if it ever is
    }

The new [`plugins.withId(String)`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/plugins/PluginContainer.html#withId\(java.lang.String,%20org.gradle.api.Action\)) 
method makes this more convenient by allowing the ID of the plugin to be used instead of the implementing class…

    plugins.withId("interesting") {
      // perform some configuration after the “interesting” plugin has been applied if it ever is
    }

The `withId()` method is now the preferred mechanism for configuration conditional on the presence of a plugin.

### Support for Ivy and Maven repositories with SFTP scheme

In addition to `file`, `http` and `https`, Ivy and Maven repositories now also support the `sftp` transport scheme. 
Currently, authentication with the SFTP server supports only username and password credentials.

Ivy dependencies can be consumed via SFTP by specifying it as the repo protocol…

    apply plugin: 'java'

    repositories {
        ivy {
            url 'sftp://127.0.0.1:22/repo'
            credentials {
                username 'sftp'
                password 'sftp'
            }
        }
    }

    dependencies {
        compile 'org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.3.1'
    }

SFTP can also be used when publishing as an Ivy module…

    apply plugin: 'java'
    apply plugin: 'ivy-publish'

    version = '2'
    group = 'org.group.name'

    publishing {
        repositories {
            ivy {
                url 'sftp://127.0.0.1:22/repo'
                credentials {
                    username 'sftp'
                    password 'sftp'
                }
            }
        }
        publications {
            ivy(IvyPublication) {
                from components.java
            }
        }
    }
    
Resolving dependencies from a SFTP server with Maven works in a similar fashion… 

    apply plugin: 'java'

    repositories {
        maven {
            url 'sftp://127.0.0.1:22/repo'
            credentials {
                username 'sftp'
                password 'sftp'
            }
        }
    }

    dependencies {
        compile 'org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.3.1'
    }

Publishing via SFTP as a Maven module is not supported at this time.

This feature was contributed by [Marcin Erdmann](https://github.com/erdi).
 
### Apache Maven POM profile activation based on absence of system property

Gradle 1.12 improved Maven interoperability by [supporting POM profiles that are active by default](http://www.gradle.org/docs/1.12/release-notes#support-for-consuming-apache-maven-poms-with-active-profiles). 
In Gradle 2.0, POM profiles that are activated by absence of a system property are now respected.

    <project>
        ...
        <profiles>
            <profile>
                <id>profile-1</id>
                <property>
                    <name>!env</name>
                </property>
            </profile>
        </profiles>
    </project>

### Fine grained control of arguments passed to native tools (i)

The new `withArguments()` method available on the command line tools of a toolchain allows complete control over the arguments passed to the tool,
after Gradle has populated the argument list based on the build model.

    apply plugin:'cpp'

    model {
        toolChains {
            visualCpp(VisualCpp) {
                cppCompiler.withArguments { List<String> args ->
                    args << "-DFRENCH"
                }
            }
            clang(Clang){
                cCompiler.withArguments { List<String> args ->
                    Collections.replaceAll(args, "CUSTOM", "-DFRENCH")
                }
                linker.withArguments { List<String> args ->
                    args.remove "CUSTOM"
                }
                staticLibArchiver.withArguments { List<String> args ->
                    args.remove "CUSTOM"
                }
            }
        }
    }

This allows for greater flexibility and use of edge tool features.

### Simplified support for native cross compilation and custom platforms (GCC based toolchains) (i)

It's now a lot easier to define a target native platform and how to use GCC to build for it.
Instead of implementing an interface you can describe a target platform and its configuration in the Gradle DSL.

When declaring a toolchain, the targeted platforms can be configured directly in the `toolChain` model. 

    model {
      toolChains {
        gcc(Gcc) {
          target("arm") {
            cppCompiler.executable = "custom-gcc"
            cppCompiler.withArguments { args ->
              args << "-m32"
            }
            linker.withArguments { args ->
              args << "-m32"
            }
          }
          target("sparc") {
          }
        }
        platforms {
          arm {
            architecture "arm"
          }
          sparc {
            architecture "sparc"
          }
        }
      }
    }    

The [User Guide](userguide/nativeBinaries.html#native_binaries:tool_chain) contains more details on how to configure Gcc compatible toolchains for cross compilation.

### New 'ivy' layout support for Ivy repositories (i)

When consuming from or publishing to an Ivy repository, a layout must be specified that describes how artifacts are organized within that repository.

In addition to the 'gradle' (default) and 'maven' layouts, you can now specify the 'ivy' layout, which is the default ivy artifact and metadata patterns.

    repositories {
      ivy {
        url 'http://my.server/repo'
          layout 'ivy'
        }
      }
    }


See the [User Guide](userguide/dependency_management.html#sec:ivy_repositories) and the
[DSL Reference](dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.repositories.IvyArtifactRepository.html#org.gradle.api.artifacts.repositories.IvyArtifactRepository:layout\(java.lang.String,%20groovy.lang.Closure\)) 
for more detail on how to use named layouts.

This feature was contributed by [Ben McCann](https://github.com/benmccann).

### Default versions of code quality tools updated

The code quality plugins now use the latest version of the corresponding tool as of the Gradle 2.0 release.

The new versions are:

- Checkstyle: 5.7
- CodeNarc: 0.21
- PMD: 5.1.1 (note that some rulesets were renamed in PMD 5, e.g. `basic` -> `java-basic`)
- Findbugs: 2.0.3
- JaCoCo: 0.7.1.201405082137

To revert back to the old version, or to use any different version, you can use the appropriate `toolVersion` property.

    pmd {
      toolVersion = '4.3'
    }

### Tooling API improvements

The Gradle tooling API allows you to inspect a Gradle build and extract useful information about that build. The `GradleProject` tooling API model now has a
`buildDirectory` property to provide access to the project's build output directory.

## Fixed issues

## Potential breaking changes

The Gradle 2.0 release contains many breaking changes, as it is a major version number change and the setting of a new compatibility baseline.

### Upgraded to Groovy 2.3.2

Gradle now uses Groovy 2.3.2 to compile and run scripts and plugins. 

Generally, Groovy is backwards compatible. 
However, this change may require that you recompile some plugins and may also require some source changes.
It is not guaranteed that Groovy based plugins built with Gradle 1.x will work with Gradle 2.x, but most will.

### Can no longer run Gradle using Java 5

Due to the upgrade to Groovy 2.3.2, Gradle can no longer be run using Java 5. 
It is still possible to build Java projects for Java 5 by running with Java 6 or higher, but configuring compilation and test execution to use a different JDK.

For more on the detail of why this was necessary, please see [this forum post](http://forums.gradle.org/gradle/topics/gradle_2_0_will_drop_support_for_java_5_and_will_fully_support_java_8).

### Upgrades to code quality tool default versions

As mentioned in “New and Noteworthy”, the default versions of all code quality tools have been updated.
Generally, these tools are backwards compatible.

### Custom TestNG listeners are applied before Gradle's listeners

This change is unlikely to affect any custom listeners, but is mentioned for completeness.

### Support for reading or changing file permissions on certain platforms with Java 6

Gradle previously supported file permissions on Solaris and on Linux ia-64 using Java 6. 
This support has been removed. 
You will receive a warning when attempting to use file permissions on these platforms.

Note that file permissions are supported on these platforms when you use Java 7 and later, and is supported for all Java
versions on Linux, OS X, Windows and FreeBSD for x86 and amd64 architectures.

If you wish to have support for file permissions on other platforms and architectures, please help us port our native integration to these platforms.

### Support for terminal integration on certain platforms

Gradle previously supported terminal integration on Solaris and Linux ia-64. 
This support has been removed. 
When you use Gradle on these platforms, Gradle will fall back to using plain text output.

Note that terminal integration is supported on Linux, OS X, Windows and FreeBSD for x86 and amd64 architectures.

If you wish to have terminal integration on other platforms and architectures, please help us port our native integration to these platforms.

### Build script changes

Gradle now assumes that all Gradle scripts are encoded using UTF-8. Previously, Gradle assumed the system encoding. This change
affects all build scripts, settings scripts and init scripts.

It is now an error to include a label on a statement in a Gradle script:

    someLabel:
    group = 'my.group'

### Native binaries model changes

A bunch of changes and renames have been made to the incubating 'native binaries' support.
For certain common usages, a backward-compatible api has been maintained.

- Package structure has changed, with many public classes being moved.
- `Library`, `Executable` and `TestSuite` renamed to `NativeLibrary`, `NativeExecutable` and `NativeTestSuite`
    - Related binary types have also been renamed
    - Kept `StaticLibraryBinary`, `SharedLibraryBinary`, `ExecutableBinary` and `TestSuiteExecutableBinary` for compatibility
- `NativeBinariesPlugin` has been renamed to `NativeComponentPlugin` with id `'native-component'`
- `NativeBinariesModelPlugin` renamed to `NativeComponentModelPlugin`
- `BuildableModelElement.lifecycleTask` renamed to `buildTask`
- `NativeBinaryTasks.getBuilder()` renamed to `getCreateOrLink()`
- `NativeBinaryTasks.getLifecycle()` renamed to `getBuild()`
- `BuildBinaryTask` renamed to `ObjectFilesToBinary`
- `PlatformConfigurableToolChain.addPlatformConfiguration(TargetPlatformConfiguration)` has been replaced by
   `PlatformConfigurableToolChain.target(...)`.

### New Java component model changes

A bunch of changes and renames have been made to the new, incubating 'java component' support.

- Package structure has changed, with many public classes being moved.

### Support for the deprecated Gradle Open API removed

- `GradleRunnerFactory` removed.
- `UIFactory` removed.
- `ExternalUtility` removed.

### Properties are no longer dynamically created on assignment

Previously, Gradle would create a property on a domain object when assigning a value to a property that does not exist:

    project.myProperty = 'some value'
    assert myProperty == 'some value'

This behavior has been deprecated for 2 years of Gradle releases and is now an error. 
Instead, you should either use the `ext` namespace or use a local variable:

    def myProperty = 'some value'
    assert myProperty == 'some value'

    // or
    ext.myProperty == 'some value'
    assert myProperty == 'some value'

### += operator changes that typically affect configuration of eclipse and idea plugin

Due to the Groovy upgrade, assigning configurations to collections via += works differently.

    //Gradle 1.12, the assignments have the same effect, both append configuration instance:
    list += configurations.compile
    list += [configurations.compile]

    //Gradle 2.0:
    list += configurations.compile //appends the files of the configuration (triggering dependency resolution!)
    list += [configurations.compile] //appends the configuration instance

Typically, this change may affect the classpath customization for eclipse and idea.
It may cause dependency resolution before any dependencies are added to the configuration.
In this case, the user can see an exception like: "You can't change configuration 'someConfig' because it is already resolved!".
See below how to resolve this problem:

    //Instead:
    eclipse.classpath.plusConfigurations += configurations.someConfig
    idea.module.scopes.COMPILE.plus += configurations.someConfig

    //Prefer below (works with Gradle 1.* and 2.0):
    eclipse.classpath.plusConfigurations += [configurations.someConfig]
    idea.module.scopes.COMPILE.plus += [configurations.someConfig]

Convention methods on `Project` added by the signing plugin:

- `sign()` replaced by `signing.sign()`.
- `signPom()` replaced by `signing.signPom()`.

### Changes to file DSL

The `Project.file()` method no longer accepts arbitrary inputs. Previously, this method would attempt to convert the result of calling `toString()`
on its parameter, if the parameter type was not recognized. This is now an error.

This method is used indirectly in many places in the Gradle DSL.

The `CopySpec.into()` method also no longer accepts arbitrary inputs. Previously, this method would attempt to conver the result of calling `toString()` on
its parameter, if the parameter type was not recognized. This is now an error.

The `Project.tarTree()` and `zipTree()` methods no longer ignores missing files. This is now an error.

### Changes to dependency management DSL

The repository DSL has changed:

- The `RepositoryHandler.mavenCentral()` method no longer handles the `urls` option. You should use the `artifactUrls` instead.
- It is now an error to change the name of an `ArtifactRepository` after it has been added to a repository container.
- The `RepositoryHandler.mavenLocal()` method no longer supports the `M2_HOME` system properties. You should use the `M2_HOME` environment variable instead.

The `Upload` task now fails when an artifact does not exist. Previously, this task would ignore the missing artifact.

### Tasks cannot be changed after task has started execution

Certain operations on a task are no longer possible once the task has started execution:

- Changing the actions of the task, such as calling `doLast { // some action }`
- Changing the dependencies of the task, such as calling `dependsOn 'someTask'`
- Changing the inputs and outputs of the task, such as calling `inputs.file('build/some-file.txt')`

This behavior was deprecated and now fails with an exception.

### Removed incubating method

- `StartParameter.setProjectPath` and `StartParameter.getProjectPath` were replaced with `TaskParameter`.

### Task constructor injection changes

Tasks are now constructed according to JSR-330. This means that a task type must either have a single public zero-args constructor, or annotate one constructor with `@Inject`.

Previously, Gradle would accept a class with a single constructor with multiple parameters that was not annotated with `@Inject`. This was deprecated in Gradle 1.2 and is now an error.

### Task constructor changes

All core Gradle task types now have a zero args constructor. The following types are affected:

- `org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test`
- `org.gradle.api.tasks.Upload`
- `org.gradle.api.plugins.quality.Checkstyle`
- `org.gradle.api.plugins.quality.CodeNarc`
- `org.gradle.api.plugins.quality.FindBugs`
- `org.gradle.api.plugins.quality.Pmd`
- `org.gradle.api.plugins.quality.JDepend`
- `org.gradle.testing.jacoco.tasks.JacocoReport`
- `org.gradle.api.tasks.GradleBuild`
- `org.gradle.api.tasks.diagnostics.DependencyInsightReportTask`
- `org.gradle.api.reporting.GenerateBuildDashboard`
- `org.gradle.api.publish.ivy.tasks.GenerateIvyDescriptor`
- `org.gradle.api.publish.maven.tasks.GenerateMavenPom`
- `org.gradle.api.publish.maven.tasks.PublishToMavenRepository`
- `org.gradle.api.publish.maven.tasks.PublishToMavenLocal`
- `org.gradle.nativebinaries.tasks.InstallExecutable`
- `org.gradle.api.plugins.buildcomparison.gradle.CompareGradleBuilds`
