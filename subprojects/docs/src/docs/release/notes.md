## New and noteworthy

Here are the new features introduced in this Gradle release.

### Daemon health monitoring

The daemon actively monitors its health and may expire earlier if its performance degrades.
The current implementation monitors the overhead of garbage collector and may detect memory issues.
Memory problems can be caused by 3rd party plugins written without performance review.
We want the Gradle daemon to be rock solid and enabled by default in the future.
This feature is a big step forward towards the goal.
Down the road the health monitoring will get richer and smarter, providing the users the insight into daemon's performance
and deciding whether to restart the daemon process.

Incubating system property "org.gradle.daemon.performance.logging" can be used to switch on an elegant message emitted at the beginning of each build.
The new information presented in the build log helps getting better understanding of daemon's performance:

    Starting 3rd build in daemon [uptime: 15 mins, performance: 92%, memory: 65% of 1.1 GB]

The logging can be turned on by tweaking "org.gradle.jvmargs" property of the gradle.properties file:

    org.gradle.jvmargs=-Dorg.gradle.daemon.performance.logging=true

### Support for AWS S3 backed maven repositories

Gradle now supports S3 backed maven repositories. Here's an example on how to declare a S3 backed maven repository in gradle:

    repositories {
        maven {
            url "s3://someS3Bucket/maven/release"
            credentials(AwsCredentials) {
                accessKey "someKey"
                secretKey "someSecret"
            }
        }
    }

A big thank you goes to Adrian Kelly for implementing this feature.

### Improved performance with class loader caching

We want each new version of Gradle to perform better.
Gradle is faster and less memory hungry when class loaders are reused between builds.
The daemon process can cache the class loader instances, and consequently, the loaded classes.
This unlocks modern jvm optimizations that lead to faster execution of consecutive builds.
This also means that if the class loader is reused, static state is preserved from the previous build.
Class loaders are not reused when build script classpath changes (for example, when the build script file is changed).

In the reference project, we observed 10% build speed improvement for the initial build invocations in given daemon process.
Later build invocations perform even better in comparison to Gradle daemon without classloader caching.

This incubating feature is not turned on by default at the moment.
It can be switched on via incubating system property "org.gradle.caching.classloaders".
Example setting in gradle.properties file:

    org.gradle.jvmargs=-Dorg.gradle.caching.classloaders=true

### Google Test support (i)

- TBD

### Model rules

A number of improvements have been made to the model rules execution used by the native language plugins:

- Added a basic `model` report to allow you to see the structure of the model for a particular project.
- `@Defaults` annotation allow logic to be applied to attach defaults to a model element.
- `@Validate` annotation allow logic to be applied to validate a model element after it has been configured.
- `CollectionBuilder` allows rules to be applied to all elements in the collection, or to a particular element, or all elements of a given type.

### Tooling API improvements

There is a new API `GradleProject#getProjectDirectory` that returns the project directory of the project.

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 3.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](http://forums.gradle.org).

## Potential breaking changes

### Model DSL changes

There have been some changes to the behaviour of the `model { ... }` block:

- The `tasks` container now delegates to a `CollectionBuilder<Task>` instead of a `TaskContainer`.
- The `components` container now delegates to a `CollectionBuilder<ComponentSpec>` instead of a `ComponentSpecContainer`.
- The `binaries` container now delegates to a `CollectionBuilder<BinarySpec>` instead of a `BinaryContainer`.

Generally, the DSL should be the same, except:

- Elements are not implicitly created. In particular, to define a task with default type, you need to use `model { tasks { myTask(Task) { ... } }`
- Elements are not created or configured eagerly, but are configured as required.
- The `create` method returns void.
- The `withType()` method selects elements based on the public contract type rather than implementation type.
- Using create syntax fails when the element already exists.
- There are currently no query method on this interface.

### Updated default zinc compiler version

The default zinc compiler version has changed from 0.3.0 to 0.3.5.3

### MavenDeployer no longer uses global Maven settings.xml

- User settings file was never used, but global settings.xml was considered
- Mirror settings no longer cause GRADLE-2681
- Authentication and Proxy settings are not used

- Local repository location in user settings.xml _is_ honoured when deploying (it was always honoured when installing)

### PublishToMavenLocal task ignores repository setting

Previously, the `PublishToMavenLocal` task could be configured with an `ArtifactRepository` instance, which would specify the
location to `install` to. The default repository was `mavenLocal()`.

It is no longer possible to override this location by supplying a repository to the `PublishToMavenLocal` task. Any supplied repository
will be ignored.
