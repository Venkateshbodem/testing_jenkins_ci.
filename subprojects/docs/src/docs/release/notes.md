### Set the character set used for filtering files in CopySpec

By default, file filtering using `CopySpec` uses the default platform character set to read and write filtered files.
This can cause problems if, for example, the files are encoded using `UTF-8` but the default platform character set is another one.

You can now define the character set to use when reading and writing filtered files per `CopySpec`, e.g.:

    task filter(type: Copy) {
        from 'some/place'
        into 'somewhere/else'
        expand(version: project.version)
        filteringCharset = 'UTF-8'
    }

See the “[Filtering files](userguide/working_with_files.html#sec:filtering_files)” section of the “Working with files” chapter in the user guide for more information and examples of using this new feature.

### Generated POM files now include classifiers and all artifacts for project dependencies

When publishing from a multi-project build to a Maven repository using the `maven` plugin, Gradle needs to map project dependencies to `<dependency>` declarations in the generated POM file. Previously, Gradle was ignoring the classifier attribute on any project artifacts, and would simply create a single `<dependency>` entry in the POM for any project dependency. This meant that the published POM for a project didn't contain the necessary dependencies to allow that project to be properly resolved from a Maven repository.

The mapping of project dependencies into POM file dependencies has been improved, and Gradle will now produce correct POM files for the following cases:

 - When the depended-on project configuration produces a single artifact with a classifier: this classifier will be included in the POM `<dependency>` entry.
 - The depended-on project configuration produces multiple artifacts: a `<dependency>` entry will be created for each artifact, with the appropriate classifier attribute for each.

As an example, given the following project definitions in Gradle:

    project(':project1') {
        dependencies {
            compile project(':project2')
            testCompile project(path: 'project2', configuration: 'testRuntime')
        }
    }

    project(':project2') {
        jar {
            classifier = 'defaultJar'
        }

        task testJar(type: Jar, dependsOn: classes) {
            from sourceSets.test.output
            classifier = 'tests'
        }

        artifacts {
            testRuntime  testJar
        }
    }

The generated POM file for `project1` will include these dependency entries:

    ...
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.gradle.test</groupId>
        <artifactId>project2</artifactId>
        <version>1.9</version>
        <classifier>defaultJar</classifier>
        <scope>compile</scope>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.gradle.test</groupId>
        <artifactId>project2</artifactId>
        <version>1.9</version>
        <classifier>tests</classifier>
        <scope>test</scope>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ...

Previously, only a single `<dependency>` entry would have been generated for 'project2', omitting the 'classifier' attribute altogether.

### Better control over Ant message logging

In previous versions of Gradle, the mapping of Ant message priorities to Gradle logging levels was fixed and the default "lifecycle"
log level was set in between the Ant "warn" and "info" priorities.  This meant that to show output from Ant tasks logged at the common "info"
priority, the Gradle logging level had to be set to a higher verbosity, potentially exposing unwanted output.  Similarly, to suppress
unwanted messages from Ant tasks, the Gradle logging level would need to be set to a lower verbosity, potentially suppressing other
desirable output.

You can now control the level of Ant logging by changing the message priority that maps to the Gradle lifecycle logging level:

    ant {
        lifecycleLogLevel = "INFO"
    }

This causes any Ant messages logged at the specified priority to be logged at the lifecycle logging level.  Any messages logged at a
higher priority will also be logged at lifecycle level (or above if it is already mapped to a higher logging level).  Messages logged
at a lower priority than the specified priority will be logged at the "info" logging level or below.

### Dependency substitution in composite build defined via `GradleConnection`

- Placeholder

### Identifier properties for IDE Tooling API models

- Placeholder

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

### `StartParameter.consoleOutput` property

The `StartParameter.consoleOutput` property has been promoted and is now stable.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 3.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](http://discuss.gradle.org).

### Setting the log level from build logic

The ability to set the log level from build logic using [LoggingManager.setLevel()](javadoc/org/gradle/api/logging/LoggingManager.html#setLevel%28org.gradle.api.logging.LogLevel%29)
is now deprecated and scheduled for removal in the next release of Gradle.  If you are using this feature to control logging of messages from Ant
tasks, please use the [AntBuilder.setLifecycleLogLevel()](javadoc/org/gradle/api/AntBuilder.html#setLifecycleLogLevel%28java.lang.String%29) method instead.

### Support for running Gradle on Java 6

Running Gradle using Java 6 is now deprecated, and support will be removed in Gradle 3.0.

It will continue to be possible to build JVM based projects for Java 6, by running Gradle using Java 7 and configuring Gradle to use Java 6 to compile, test and run your code.

### `StartParameter.colorOutput` property

The `StartParameter.colorOutput` property has been deprecated and will be removed in Gradle 3.0. You should use the `consoleOutput` property instead.

### Tooling API model properties

- `EclipseProjectDependency.targetProject` has been deprecated, use `EclipseProjectDependency.target` instead.

## Potential breaking changes

### Gradle implementation dependencies are not visible to plugins at development time

Implementing a Gradle plugin requires the declaration of `gradleApi()`
to the `compile` configuration. The resolved dependency encompasses the
entire Gradle runtime including Gradle's third party dependencies
(e.g. Guava). Any third party dependencies declared by the plugin might
conflict with the ones pulled in by the `gradleApi()` declaration. Gradle
does not apply conflict resolution. As a result The user will end up with
two addressable copies of a dependency on the compile classpath and in
 the test runtime classpath.

In previous versions of Gradle the dependency `gradleTestKit()`, which
relies on a Gradle runtime, attempts to address this problem via class
relocation. The use of `gradleApi()` and `gradleTestKit()` together
became unreliable as classes of duplicate name but of different content
were added to the classpath.

With this version of Gradle proper class relocation has been implemented
 across the dependencies `gradleApi()`, `gradleTestKit()` and the published
 Tooling API JAR. Projects using any of those dependencies will not
 conflict anymore with classes from third party dependencies used by
 the Gradle runtime. Classes from third-party libraries provided by
 the Gradle runtime are no longer "visible" at compile and test
 time.

### Change in plugin id

`ComponentModelBasePlugin` can no longer be applied using id `component-base`. Its new id is `component-model-base`.

### JAR metadata and Manifest content encoding

Previous versions of Gradle used to encode JAR/WAR/EAR files metadata and Manifests content using the platform default character set instead of UTF-8. Both are bugs and have been fixed in this release, see the related fixed issues above.

In order to keep backward compatibility, merged manifests are still read using the platform default character set.

If necessary, convenience properties have been added to [`Jar`](dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Jar.html), [`War`](dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.War.html), [`Ear`](dsl/org.gradle.plugins.ear.Ear.html) tasks and both [`Manifest`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/java/archives/Manifest.html) and [`ManifestMergeSpec`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/java/archives/ManifestMergeSpec.html) types to control which character set to use when merging manifests.

In order to fall back to the old behaviour you can do the following:

    jar {
        # JAR metadata
        metadataCharset = Charset.defaultCharset().name()
        manifest {
            # Manifest content
            contentCharset = Charset.defaultCharset().name()
        }
    }

### Additional POM `<dependency>` attributes generated for some project dependencies

As described above, POM files generated by the `maven` plugin now include classifiers and all artifacts for project dependencies. This improvement may break existing Gradle builds, particularly those that include a specific workaround for the previous behaviour. These workarounds should no longer be required, and may need to be removed to ensure that Gradle 2.14 will create correct `<dependency>` attributes for project dependencies.

### Removed internal methods in `AbstractTask`

The `setProject()` and `setName()` methods are no longer available.
