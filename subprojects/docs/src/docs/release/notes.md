## New and noteworthy

Here are the new features introduced in this Gradle release.

### Incremental java compilation

Gradle 2.1 brings incubating support for compiling java code incrementally.
When this feature is enabled, only classes that are considered stale are recompiled.
This way not only the compiler does less work, but also fewer output class files are touched.
The latter feature is extremely important for scenarios involving JRebel - the less output files are touched the quicker the jvm gets refreshed classes.

We will improve the speed and capability of the incremental java compiler. Please give use feedback how does it work for your scenarios.
For more detailss please see the user guide section on “[Incremental compilation](userguide/java_plugin.html#sec:incremental_compile)”.
To enable the feature, configure the [JavaCompile](dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.compile.JavaCompile.html) task accordingly:

    //configuring a single task:
    compileJava.options.incremental = true

    //configuring all tasks from root project:
    subprojects {
        tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {
            options.incremental = true
        }
    }

We are very excited about the progress on the incremental java compilation.
Class dependency analysis of compiled classes is really useful for many other scenarios that Gradle will handle in future:

* detection of unused jars/classes
* detection of duplicate classes on classpath
* detection of tests to execute
* and more

### Child processes started by Gradle are better described

At the [Gradle Summit 2014 Conference](http://www.gradlesummit.com/conference/santa_clara/2014/06/home)
we ran a [Contributing To Gradle Workshop](http://www.gradlesummit.com/conference/santa_clara/2014/06/session?id=31169).
During the session, [Rob Spieldenner](https://github.com/rspieldenner)
contributed a very nice feature that gives much better insight into the child processes started by Gradle.
The example output of `jps -m` command now also contains the function of the worker process:

    28649 GradleWorkerMain 'Gradle Test Executor 17'
    28630 GradleWorkerMain 'Gradle Compiler Daemon 1'

### Java Gradle Plugin plugin

This is a plugin to assist in developing gradle plugins.  It validates the plugin structure during the jar task and emits warnings
if the plugin metadata is not valid.

    apply plugin: 'java-gradle-plugin'
    
### PMD Console Output (i)

It is now possible to have [PMD static analysis](userguide/pmd_plugin.html) output results directly to the console.

    pmd {
      consoleOutput = true
    }

Output will be written to `System.out` in addition to any configured reports.

This feature was contributed by [Vyacheslav Blinov](https://github.com/dant3).

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 3.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](http://forums.gradle.org).

## Potential breaking changes

### Changed Java compiler integration for joint Java - Scala compilation

The `ScalaCompile` task type now uses the same Java compiler integration as the `JavaCompile` and `GroovyCompile` task types for performing joint Java - Scala
compilation. Previously it would use the old Ant-based Java compiler integration, which is no longer supported in the Gradle 2.x stream.

This change should be backwards compatible for all users, and should improve compilation time when compiling Java and Scala together.

### Incubating native language plugins no longer apply the base plugin

The native language plugins now apply the [`LifecycleBasePlugin`](dsl/org.gradle.language.base.plugins.LifecycleBasePlugin) instead of the `BasePlugin`. This means
that the default values defined by the `BasePlugin` are not available.

TBD - make this more explicit re. what is actually not longer available.

### Changes to incubating Java language plugins

To better support the production of multiple binary outputs for a single set of sources, a new set of Java
language plugins was been introduced in Gradle 1.x. This development continues in this release, with the removal of the
`jvm-lang` plugin, and the replacement of the `java-lang` plugin with a completely new implementation.

The existing `java` plugin is unchanged: only users who explicitly applied the `jvm-lang` or `java-lang` plugins
will be affected by this change.

### Internal methods removed

- The internal method `Javadoc.setJavadocExecHandleBuilder()` has been removed. You should use `setToolChain()` instead.
