= Writing Tasks

The work that Gradle can do on a project is defined by one or more _tasks_.

image::author-gradle-1.png[]

A task represents some atomic piece of work that a build performs.
This might be compiling some classes, creating a JAR, generating Javadoc, or publishing some archives to a repository.

You run a Gradle build using the `gradle` command or by invoking the Gradle Wrapper (`./gradlew' or `gradle.bat`) in your project directory.

As part of the build process, Gradle finds all the tasks in your project coded in plugins or build scripts.

== Listing available tasks

Gradle provides several default tasks for a project, which are listed by running `./gradlew tasks`:

[source]
----
------------------------------------------------------------
Tasks runnable from root project 'myTutorial'
------------------------------------------------------------

Build Setup tasks
-----------------
init - Initializes a new Gradle build.
wrapper - Generates Gradle wrapper files.

Help tasks
----------
buildEnvironment - Displays all buildscript dependencies declared in root project 'myTutorial'.
...
----

Tasks either come from build scripts or plugins.

Once we apply a plugin to our project, such as the `application` plugin, additional tasks are available, including:

[source]
----
Application tasks
-----------------
run - Runs this project as a JVM application

Build tasks
-----------
assemble - Assembles the outputs of this project.
build - Assembles and tests this project.

...

Documentation tasks
-------------------
javadoc - Generates Javadoc API documentation for the main source code.

...

Other tasks
-----------
compileJava - Compiles main Java source.

...
----

This is because the `application` plugin code contains additional tasks now available in your project.

== Task classification

Two classes of tasks can be executed:

1. *Actionable tasks* have some action(s) attached to do work in your build: `compileJava`.
2. *Lifecycle tasks* are workflow tasks with no actions attached: `assemble`, `build`.


[[sec:hello_world]]
== Hello world

Let's take a look at a simple "Hello World" task in a build script:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/hello/kotlin", files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/hello/groovy", files="build.gradle[]"]
====

In the example, the build script registers a single task called `hello`, and adds an action.

Now, when the Gradle tasks are listed, the `hello` task is available:

[source]
----
$ ./gradlew app:tasks --all

> Task :app:tasks

------------------------------------------------------------
Tasks runnable from project ':app'
------------------------------------------------------------

Other tasks
-----------
compileJava - Compiles main Java source.
compileTestJava - Compiles test Java source.
hello
processResources - Processes main resources.
processTestResources - Processes test resources.
startScripts - Creates OS specific scripts to run the project as a JVM application.
----

You can execute the task in the build script with `./gradlew -q hello`:

====
----
$ ./gradlew -q hello
include::{snippetsPath}/tutorial/hello/tests/hello.out[]
----
====

[TIP]
====
The `-q` option suppresses Gradle's log messages, showing only the tasks' output.
====

When you run `./gradlew hello`, Gradle executes the `hello` task, which executes the action you've provided.
The action is simply a block containing some code to execute: `println("Hello world!")`.

== Task group and description

The `hello` task from the previous section can be further detailed with a `description` and assigned to a `group`.

[source]
----
tasks.register("hello") {
    group = "Custom"
    description = "A lovely greeting task."
    doLast {
        println("Hello world!")
    }
}
----

Once the task is assigned to a `group`, it will be listed by `./gradlew tasks`:

[source]
----
$ ./gradlew tasks

> Task :tasks

Custom tasks
------------------
hello - A lovely greeting task.
----

[[sec:build_scripts_are_code]]
== Task types
Gradle tasks are a subclass of link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.DefaultTask.html[`DefaultTask`].

When creating a custom task class, you extend link:{kotlinDslPath}/gradle/org.gradle.api/-default-task/index.html[`DefaultTask`]:

[source, build.gradle.kts]
----
abstract class HelloTask : DefaultTask() {
    @TaskAction
    fun hello() {
        println("hello from HelloTask")
    }
}

tasks.register<HelloTask>("hello") {
    group = "Custom tasks"
    description = "A lovely greeting task."
}
----

Executing our new `hello` task yields the following:

[source]
----
$ ./gradlew hello

> Task :app:hello
hello from HelloTask
----

In the build script, the `HelloTask` class is created by subclassing `DefaultTask`.

The `hello` task is then registered with the *type* `HelloTask`.

== View task types
To view information about a task, including its type, use the `help --task <task-name>` command:

[source]
----
$ ./gradlew help --task hello

> Task :help
Detailed task information for hello

Path
:app:hello

Type
HelloTask (Build_gradle$HelloTask)

Options
--rerun     Causes the task to be re-run even if up-to-date.

Description
A lovely greeting task.

Group
Custom tasks
----

== Built-in task types
Gradle provides many built-in tasks types with common and popular functionality, such as copying or deleting files.

This example task copies `*.war` files from the `source` directory to the `target` directory using the `Copy` built-in task:

[source]
----
tasks.register("copyTask",Copy) {
    from("source")
    into("target")
    include("*.war")
}
----

There are many task types, including `GroovyDoc`, `Zip`, `Jar`, `JacocoReport`, `Sign`, `Delete`, and link:link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.plugins.antlr.AntlrTask.html[much more].

[[sec:task_dependencies]]
== Task dependencies

You can declare tasks that depend on other tasks:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/intro/kotlin", files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/intro/groovy", files="build.gradle[]"]

----
$ gradle -q intro
include::{snippetsPath}/tutorial/intro/tests/intro.out[]
----
====

To add a dependency, the corresponding task does not need to exist:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/lazyDependsOn/kotlin", files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/lazyDependsOn/groovy", files="build.gradle[]"]

----
$ gradle -q taskX
include::{snippetsPath}/tutorial/lazyDependsOn/tests/lazyDependsOn.out[]
----
====

The dependency of `taskX` to `taskY` may be declared before `taskY` is defined.

[[sec:dynamic_tasks]]
== Flexible task registration

The capabilities of the Groovy or Kotlin language can be used in a task.

As an example, you can register multiple tasks of the same type in a loop:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/dynamic/kotlin", files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/dynamic/groovy", files="build.gradle[]"]

----
$ gradle -q task1
include::{snippetsPath}/tutorial/dynamic/tests/dynamic.out[]
----
====

[[sec:manipulating_existing_tasks]]
== Manipulating existing tasks

Once tasks are registered, they can be accessed via an _API_.

For instance, you can use this to dynamically add dependencies to a task, at runtime:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/dynamicDepends/kotlin", files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/dynamicDepends/groovy", files="build.gradle[]"]

----
$ gradle -q task0
include::{snippetsPath}/tutorial/dynamicDepends/tests/dynamicDepends.out[]
----
====

Or you can add behavior to an existing task:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/helloEnhanced/kotlin", files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/helloEnhanced/groovy", files="build.gradle[]"]

----
$ gradle -q hello
include::{snippetsPath}/tutorial/helloEnhanced/tests/helloEnhanced.out[]
----
====

The calls `doFirst` and `doLast` can be executed multiple times.
They add an action to the beginning or the end of the task's actions list.
When the task executes, the actions in the action list are executed in order.
