[[build_lifecycle]]
= Build Lifecycle

Gradle is an example of *dependency-based programming*: you define tasks and dependencies between tasks.

image::author-gradle-1.png[]

Gradle guarantees that these tasks will execute in order of their dependencies.
Your build scripts and plugins configure this dependency graph.

For example, if your project tasks include `assemble`, `build`, `createDocs`, your build script(s) can make sure that they are executed in the order `assemble` -> `build` -> `createDoc`.

There are phases Gradle passes through as it interprets those scripts.

== Task Graphs

Gradle builds the task graph *before* executing any task.

Within each project, tasks form a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph[Directed Acyclic Graph] (DAG).

This diagram shows two example task graphs, one abstract and the other concrete, with dependencies between tasks represented as arrows:

[[build_lifecycle_events]]
Both plugins and build scripts contribute to the task graph via the <<using_tasks.adoc#sec:task_dependencies,task dependency mechanism>>.

[[sec:build_phases]]
== Build Phases

A Gradle build has three distinct phases.

Gradle runs these phases in order:

Phase 1. Initialization::
- Detects the `settings.gradle(.kts)` file.
- Creates a link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings.html[`Settings`] instance.
- Evaluates the settings file to determine which projects (and included builds) make up the build.
- Creates a link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.Project.html[`Project`] instance for every project.
Phase 2. Configuration::
- Evaluates the build scripts, `build.gradle(.kts)`, of every project participating in the build.
- Creates a task graph for requested tasks.
Phase 3. Execution::
- Schedules and executes the selected tasks.
- Dependencies between tasks determine execution order.
- Execution of tasks can occur in parallel.

=== Example

The following example shows which parts of settings and build files correspond to various build phases:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/buildlifecycle/basic/kotlin",files="settings.gradle.kts[];build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/buildlifecycle/basic/groovy",files="settings.gradle[];build.gradle[]"]
====

The following command configures and executes the `test` and `testBoth` tasks specified above.
Because Gradle only configures requested tasks and their dependencies, the `configured` task never configures:

[source.multi-language-sample,kotlin]
----
> gradle test testBoth
include::{snippetsPath}/buildlifecycle/basic/tests/buildlifecycle.out[]
----
[source.multi-language-sample,groovy]
----
> gradle test testBoth
include::{snippetsPath}/buildlifecycle/basic/tests/buildlifecycle.out[]
----

[[sec:initialization]]
== Phase 1. Initialization

In the *initialization phase*, Gradle detects the set of projects (root and subprojects) and included builds participating in the build.

Gradle first evaluates the settings file, `settings.gradle(.kts)`, and instantiates a `Settings` object.
Then, Gradle instantiates `Project` instances for each project.

=== Detect Settings File

When you run Gradle in a directory that contains a `settings.gradle(.kts)` file, Gradle uses that `settings.gradle(.kts)` file to initialize the build using a link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings.html[`Settings`] object.

When you run Gradle in a directory that contains *no* `settings.gradle(.kts)` file, Gradle looks for the file by recursively going up parent directories.
If no file is found, Gradle assumes the project is a single project (not a multi-project build).

In a standard Gradle project, <<intro_multi_project_builds#sec:project_path,project paths>> match the physical subproject layout on disk.

The automatic search for a settings file only works for multi-project builds with a standard project layout.
To build projects that use a nonstandard layout, execute the build from the directory that contains the `settings.gradle(.kts)` file.

=== Evaluate Settings File

During settings file evaluation, Gradle:

- Instantiates a link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings.html[`Settings`] object.
- Adds libraries to your build script classpath.
- Defines which included builds participate in a composite build.
- Defines which projects participate in a multi-project build.

=== Create `Project` Object(s)

Gradle creates a link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.Project.html[`Project`] for every project in the build.

By default, each `Project` has a name equal to the name of its top level directory.

Every project except the root project has a parent project.
Any project may have child projects.

[[sec:configuration]]
== Phase 2. Configuration

In the *configuration phase*, Gradle adds tasks and other properties to the projects found by the initialization phase.

[[sec:project_evaluation]]
=== Project Evaluation

During project evaluation, Gradle evaluates build scripts (`build.gradle(.kts)`) to build a task hierarchy within a `Project`.
This hierarchy includes inputs, actions, and outputs for all tasks.

=== Task Execution Graph Assembly

During project evaluation, Gradle assembles the *task execution graph*: a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph[DAG] representing the dependency relationships between tasks.

=== Task Evaluation

During project evaluation, Gradle registers tasks and their configuration actions.
The configuration actions define inputs, outputs, and actions for those tasks.
Then, the task is evaluated to determine if it is part of the task graph for the requested tasks.

By the end of the configuration phase, Gradle has a complete task execution graph for the requested tasks.

[[sec:execution]]
== Phase 3. Execution

In the *execution phase*, Gradle runs tasks.

Gradle uses the task execution graphs generated by the configuration phase to determine which tasks to execute.

[[sec:task_execution]]
=== Task Execution

Task execution includes most of the work you usually associate with a build: downloading libraries, compiling code, reading inputs, and writing outputs.
