= Writing Settings Files

The settings file is the entry point of every Gradle project.

image::author-gradle-3.png[Settings,500,63,align="center"]

Early in the Gradle Build lifecycle, the <<build_lifecycle.adoc#sec:initialization,initialization phase>> finds the settings file in your <<directory_layout#dir:project_root,project root directory>>.

When the settings file `settings.gradle(.kts)` is found, Gradle instantiates a link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings.html[`Settings`] object.

One of the purposes of the `Settings` object is to allow you to declare all the projects to be included in the build.

[[sec:settings_script]]
== Settings Scripts

The settings script is either a `settings.gradle` file written in Groovy or a `settings.gradle.kts` file written in Kotlin.

Before Gradle assembles the projects for a build, it creates a `Settings` instance and executes the settings file against it.

As the settings script executes, it configures this `Settings`.
Therefore, the _settings file_ defines the `Settings` object.

[IMPORTANT]
====
There is a one-to-one correspondence between a `Settings` instance and a `settings.gradle(.kts)` file.
====

== The `Settings` Object

The `Settings` object is part of the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/initialization/Settings.html[Gradle API].

- In the Groovy DSL, the `Settings` object documentation is found link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings.html[here].
- In the Kotlin DSL, the `Settings` object documentation is found link:{kotlinDslPath}/org.gradle.api.initialization/-settings/index.html[here].

Many top-level properties and blocks in a build script are part of the Settings API.

For example, we can set the root project name in the settings script using the `Settings.rootProject` property:

[source]
----
settings.rootProject.name = "root"
----

Which can be shortened to:

[source]
----
rootProject.name = "root"
----

[[sec:standard_settings_properties]]
=== Standard `Settings` properties

The `Settings` object exposes a standard set of properties in your settings script.

The following table lists a few commonly used properties:

[%autowidth.stretch]
|===
| Name | Description

| `buildCache`
| The build cache configuration.

| `plugins`
| The container of plugins that have been applied to this object.

| `rootDir`
| The root directory of the build. The root directory is the project directory of the root project.

| `rootProject`
| The root project of the build.

| `settings`
| Returns this settings object.
|===

The following table lists a few commonly used methods:

[%autowidth.stretch]
|===
| Name | Description

| `apply()`
| Applies zero or more plugins or scripts.

| `include()`
| Adds the given projects to the build.

| `includeBuild()`
| Includes a build at the specified path to the composite build.
|===

[[sec:the_script_api]]
== The Script API

When Gradle executes a Groovy settings script (`settings.gradle`), it compiles the script into a class that implements link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.Script.html[`Script`].

As a result, settings scripts have access to all properties and methods declared by the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.Script.html[`Script`] interface.

When Gradle executes a Kotlin settings script (`settings.gradle.kts`), it compiles the script into a subclass of link:{kotlinDslPath}/gradle/org.gradle.kotlin.dsl/-kotlin-settings-script/index.html[`KotlinSettingsScript`].

As a result, settings scripts have access to all visible properties and functions declared by the link:{kotlinDslPath}/gradle/org.gradle.kotlin.dsl/-kotlin-settings-script/index.html[`KotlinSettingsScript`] type.

The Script API is particularly useful for working with files and paths; it provides useful methods such as `copy()`, `delete()`, `exec()` and `uri()` that are not available via the `Settings` object.

== Settings Script structure

Let's take a look at an example and break it down:

=== Define shared plugins, included builds, and their location

The settings file can optionally define the plugins your project uses with `pluginManagement`, including binary repositories such as the Gradle Plugin Portal or other Gradle builds using `includeBuild`:

[source]
----
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
        google()
    }
    includeBuild("../my-build-logic")
}
----

You can also include plugins and plugin dependency strategies in this block.

=== Apply shared plugins

The settings file can optionally define the plugins which are used as shared configurations among several builds / subprojects:

[source]
----
plugins {
    id("org.gradle.toolchains.fake") version "0.6.0"
}
----

This is typically used to ensure that all subprojects use the same version of a plugin.

=== Define the root project name

The settings file defines your project name using the `rootProject.name` property:

[source]
----
rootProject.name = "root-project" // settings.rootProject.name = "root-project"
----

There is only one root per project.

=== Add components and dependencies

The settings file can optionally define the locations of components your project relies on using `repositories` such as binary repositories like Maven Central and/or other Gradle builds using `includeBuild`:

[source]
----
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    includeBuild("../other-project")
}
----

You can also include version catalogs in this section.

=== Add subprojects to the build

The settings file defines the structure of the project by adding all the subprojects using the `include` statement:

[source]
----
include("app")
include("business-logic")
include("data-model")
----


=== Additional settings

There are many more properties and methods on the `Settings` object that you can use to configure your build.

It's important to remember that while many Gradle scripts are typically written in short Groovy or Kotlin syntax, every item in the settings script is essentially invoking a method on the `Settings` object in the Gradle API:

[source]
----
include("app")
----

Is actually:

[source]
----
settings.include("app")
----

Additionally, the full power of the Groovy and Kotlin languages is available to you.

For example, instead of using `include` many times to add subprojects, you can iterate over the list of directories in the project root folder and include them automatically:

[source]
----
rootDir.listFiles().filter { it.isDirectory && !it.isHidden }.forEach {
    include{it.name}
}
----
