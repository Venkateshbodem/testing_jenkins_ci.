= Part 2: The Build Lifecycle

Learn the Gradle build lifecycle.

****
**In this section you will:**

- Understand the Build Lifecycle
- Run a task to view it in action
****

[[part2_begin]]
== Step 0. Before you Begin

1. You initialized your Java app in <<partr1_gradle_init.adoc#part1_begin,part 1>>.

== Step 1. Understanding the Build Lifecycle

A Gradle build has three distinct phases:

Initialization  :: Gradle supports single and multi-project builds. During the initialization phase, Gradle determines which projects are going to take part in the build, and creates a Project instance for each of these projects.

Configuration  :: During this phase the project objects are configured. The build scripts of all projects which are part of the build are executed. Gradle 1.4 introduced an incubating opt-in feature called configuration on demand. In this mode, Gradle configures only relevant projects (see Section 57.1.1.1, “Configuration on demand”).

Execution  :: Gradle determines the subset of the tasks, created and configured during the configuration phase, to be executed. The subset is determined by the task name arguments passed to the gradle command and the current directory. Gradle then executes each of the selected tasks.

== Step 2.

[source, settings.gradle]
----
println 'This is executed during the initialization phase.'
----

[source, build.gradle]
----
println 'This is executed during the configuration phase.'

task configured {
println 'This is also executed during the configuration phase.'
}

task test << {
println 'This is executed during the execution phase.'
}
----
