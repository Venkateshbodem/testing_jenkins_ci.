[[partr2_build_lifecycle]]
= Part 2: The Build Lifecycle

Learn the Gradle build lifecycle.

****
**In this section you will:**

- Understand the Build Lifecycle
- Run a task to view it in action
****

[[part2_begin]]
== Step 0. Before you Begin

1. You initialized your Java app in <<partr1_gradle_init.adoc#part1_begin,part 1>>.

== Step 1. Understanding the Build Lifecycle

A Gradle build has three distinct phases:

Phase 1 - Initialization  :: During the initialization phase, Gradle determines which projects are going to take part in the build, and creates a `Project` instance for each of these projects.

Phase 2 - Configuration  :: During this phase, the `Project` objects are configured using the build scripts of all projects which are part of the build are executed.

Phase 3 - Execution  :: Gradle determines the set of tasks, created and configured during the configuration phase, to be executed. Gradle then executes each of the selected tasks.

When Gradle is invoked to execute a task, the lifecycle begins:

== Step 2. Update the Settings File

Add the following line to the Settings file:

.settings.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin]
----
println("SETTINGS FILE: This is executed during the initialization phase")
----

== Step 3. Update the Build Script

Add the following lines to the Build script:

.build.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin]
----
println("BUILD SCRIPT: This is executed during the configuration phase")

tasks.register("lifecycle"){
    println("REGISTER TASK: This is executed during the configuration phase")
}

tasks.named("lifecycle"){
    println("NAMED TASK: This is executed during the configuration phase")
    doLast {
        println("NAMED TASK: This is executed during the execution phase")
    }
}
----

== Step 4. Run a Gradle Task

Run the `lifecycle` task created in Step 3:

[source]
----
$ ./gradlew lifecycle
----

[source]
----
SETTINGS FILE: This is executed during the initialization phase <1>

> Configure project :app
BUILD SCRIPT: This is executed during the configuration phase   <2>
REGISTER TASK: This is executed during the configuration phase  <2>
NAMED TASK: This is executed during the configuration phase     <2>

> Task :app:lifecycle
NAMED TASK: This is executed during the execution phase         <3>

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 335ms
1 actionable task: 1 executed
----
<1> *Initialization*: Gradle executes `settings.gradle.kts` to determine the projects to be built and creates a `Project` object for each one.
<2> *Configuration*: Gradle configures each project by executing the `build.gradle.kts` files. It resolves dependencies and creates a dependency graph of all the available tasks.
<3> *Execution*: Gradle executes the tasks passed on the command line as well as any dependent tasks.
