[[build_lifecycle]]
= Build Lifecycle

Gradle is an example of *dependency based programming*: you define tasks and dependencies between tasks.
Gradle guarantees that these tasks execute in the order of their dependencies.
Your build scripts and plugins configure this dependency graph.
This page discusses the phases of the lifecycle Gradle passes through as it interprets those scripts.
Additionally, this page explains how you can react to events of the lifecycle using notifications.

== Task Graphs

Some build tools assemble a task graph lazily, as they execute tasks.
Gradle builds the complete task graph eagerly, before executing any task.

Within each project, tasks form a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph[Directed Acyclic Graph] (DAG).

This diagram shows two example task graphs: one abstract and the other concrete.
The diagram represents dependencies between tasks as arrows:

.Two examples of Gradle task graphs

Both plugins and your own build scripts contribute to the task graph via the <<tutorial_using_tasks#sec:task_dependencies,task dependency mechanism>>.

[[sec:build_phases]]
== Build Phases

A Gradle build has three distinct phases.
Gradle runs these phases in order: first initialization, then configuration, and finally execution.

Initialization::
- Detects the settings file.
- Evaluates the <<organizing_gradle_projects#sec:settings_file,settings file>> to determine which projects and included builds participate in the build.
- Creates a link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.Project.html[`Project`] instance for every project.
Configuration::
- Evaluates the build scripts of every project participating in the build.
- Creates a task graph for all projects.
Execution::
- Schedules and executes each of the selected tasks in the order of their dependencies.

=== Example

The following example shows which parts of settings and build files correspond to various build phases:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/buildlifecycle/basic/groovy",files="settings.gradle[];build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/buildlifecycle/basic/kotlin",files="settings.gradle.kts[];build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

[source.multi-language-sample,groovy]
----
> gradle test testBoth
include::{snippetsPath}/buildlifecycle/basic/tests/buildlifecycle.out[]
----
[source.multi-language-sample,kotlin]
----
> gradle test testBoth
include::{snippetsPath}/buildlifecycle/basic/tests/buildlifecycle.out[]
----

[[sec:initialization]]
== Initialization

In the initialization phase, Gradle detects the set of projects and included builds participating in the build.
Then, Gradle evaluates the settings file. Finally, Gradle instantiates `Project` instances for each project.

=== Detect Settings File

When you run Gradle in a directory that contains a `settings.gradle` file, Gradle uses that `settings.gradle` file to initialize the build.
You can run Gradle within any subproject of the build.footnote:[Gradle supports partial multi-project builds (see <<intro_multi_project_builds.adoc#intro_multi_project_builds,Executing Multi-Project Builds>>).]
When you run Gradle in a directory that contains *no* `settings.gradle` file:

. Gradle looks for a `settings.gradle` file in parent directories.
. If Gradle finds a `settings.gradle` file, Gradle checks if the current project is part of the multi-project build. If so, Gradle builds as a multi-project.
. If Gradle does not find a `settings.gradle` file, Gradle builds as a single project.

In the standard Gradle project layout, project paths match the physical subproject layout on disk.
The automatic search for a `settings.gradle` file only works for multi-project builds with a standard project layout.
To build projects that use a nonstandard layout, execute the build from the directory that contains `settings.gradle`.

=== Evaluate Settings File

During settings file evaluation, Gradle:

- Adds libraries to your build script classpath.
- Defines which included builds participate in a composite build.
- Defines which projects participate in a multi-project build.

Gradle creates a `Project` for every project in the build.
By default, each `Project` has a name equal to the name of its top level directory.
Every project except the root project has a parent project.
Any project may have child projects.

== Configuration

In the configuration phase, Gradle adds tasks and other properties to the projects generated by the initialization phase.
By the end of the configuration phase, Gradle has a complete task execution graph for each project.

[[sec:project_evaluation]]
=== Project Evaluation

During project evaluation, Gradle evaluates build scripts to build a task hierarchy within a `Project`.
This hierarchy includes inputs, actions, and outputs for all tasks.

==== React to Project Evaluation

You can receive a notification immediately before and immediately after a project evaluates.
These notifications work even when project evaluation fails.
You can configure project evaluation notifications for all projects or a specific project.
For example, you could use these notifications for:

- additional configuration after applying all definitions in a build script
- custom logging
- custom profiling

The following example adds a `test` task to each project where the `hasTests` property value is `true`:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/buildlifecycle/projectEvaluateEvents/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=after-evaluate];project-a.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/buildlifecycle/projectEvaluateEvents/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=after-evaluate];project-a.gradle.kts[]"]
====

----
> gradle -q test
include::{snippetsPath}/buildlifecycle/projectEvaluateEvents/tests/projectEvaluateEvents.out[]
----

The following example uses `Project.afterEvaluate()` to run logic when a project finishes evaluation:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/buildlifecycle/buildProjectEvaluateEvents/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=evaluate-events]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/buildlifecycle/buildProjectEvaluateEvents/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=evaluate-events]"]
====

The following example runs logic when *any* project finishes evaluation:

[source.multi-language-sample,groovy]
----
> gradle -q test
include::{snippetsPath}/buildlifecycle/buildProjectEvaluateEvents/tests-groovy/buildProjectEvaluateEvents.groovy.out[]
----
[source.multi-language-sample,kotlin]
----
> gradle -q test
include::{snippetsPath}/buildlifecycle/buildProjectEvaluateEvents/tests-kotlin/buildProjectEvaluateEvents.kotlin.out[]
----

To receive these events via a listener instead of a closure, add a link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/ProjectEvaluationListener.html[ProjectEvaluationListener] to a build's link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.invocation.Gradle.html[Gradle] instance.

=== Task Execution Graph Assembly

During project evaluation, Gradle assembles the *task execution graph*: a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph[DAG] representing the dependency relationships between tasks.

[[sec:task_execution_graph_ready]]
=== React to Task Execution Graph Assembly

You can receive a notification immediately after Gradle finishes populating a project's task execution graph.

To receive these events, add a link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/execution/TaskExecutionGraphListener.html[TaskExecutionGraphListener] to a project's link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/execution/TaskExecutionGraph.html[TaskExecutionGraph].

=== Task Creation

During project evaluation, Gradle registers tasks and their configuration actions. The configuration actions define inputs, outputs, and actions for those tasks. They are evaluated if the task is part of the task graph for the requested tasks.

[[sec:task_creation]]
==== React to Task Creation

You can receive a notification immediately after Gradle adds a task to a project.
For example, you could use these notifications to set some default values or methods.

The following example sets a `srcDir` value on each task in a project:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/buildlifecycle/taskCreationEvents/groovy",files="build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/buildlifecycle/taskCreationEvents/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

----
> gradle -q a
include::{snippetsPath}/buildlifecycle/taskCreationEvents/tests/taskCreationEvents.out[]
----

To receive these events via a listener instead of a closure, add an link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/Action.html[Action] to a link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/TaskContainer.html[TaskContainer].

== Execution

In the execution phase, Gradle runs tasks.
Gradle uses the task execution graphs generated by the configuration phase to determine which tasks to execute.

[[sec:task_execution]]
=== Task Execution

Task execution includes most of the work you normally associate with a build: downloading libraries, compiling code, reading inputs, and writing outputs.

==== React to Task Execution Notifications

You can receive a notification immediately before and after Gradle executes any task.
These notifications work even when task execution fails.
The following example logs the start and end of each task execution:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/buildlifecycle/taskExecutionEvents/groovy",files="build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/buildlifecycle/taskExecutionEvents/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

[source.multi-language-sample,groovy]
----
> gradle -q broken
include::{snippetsPath}/buildlifecycle/taskExecutionEvents/tests-groovy/taskExecutionEvents.groovy.out[]
----
[source.multi-language-sample,kotlin]
----
> gradle -q broken
include::{snippetsPath}/buildlifecycle/taskExecutionEvents/tests-kotlin/taskExecutionEvents.kotlin.out[]
----

To receive these events via a listener instead of a closure, add a link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/execution/TaskExecutionListener.html[TaskExecutionListener] to a project's link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/execution/TaskExecutionGraph.html[TaskExecutionGraph].
