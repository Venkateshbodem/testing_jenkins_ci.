        <title>What is the Gradle Continuous mode?</title>
        <para>
            When run in continuous mode, Gradle will execute a build and determine any files that are inputs to that build. 
            Gradle will then watch for changes to those input files, and re-execute the build when any file changes.

                The <literal>--watch</literal> command line switches enables the continous mode.

            <title>New source directories won't be noticed</title>
            <para>
                The continous mode will start watching only those source directories that exist when the build starts.
                Let's say <literal>src/test/groovy</literal> directory is missing and the user creates it just before adding a new source file.
                This change will stay unnoticed by the continous mode.

            <title>No native file system notifications on Mac OS X</title>
            <para>
                Dispite the Java JVM has the WatchService API since Java 7, this API doesn't have a native implementation on Mac OS X in Java 7 or Java 8. 
                <ulink url="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-7133447">JDK-7133447</ulink> is the open issue in the Java bug tracker.
                The Java JVM uses a polling implementation of the WatchService API on Mac OS X for filesystem events. That has longer latency than the native implementations used on 
                Windows and Linux and doesn't scale so well for very large projects with lots of source directories.
