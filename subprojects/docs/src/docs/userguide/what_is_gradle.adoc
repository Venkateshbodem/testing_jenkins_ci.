= What is Gradle?

Gradle is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation[build automation] tool.

== Gradle Build Tool

Gradle Build Tool is the fast and dependable open source build system that automates building software of any type, size or complexity.

== Gradle Enterprise

https://gradle.com/[Gradle Enterprise] is a powerful subscription based tool for managing and monitoring complex software builds.
It provides teams with centralized visibility into their build process to quickly identify and address issues as they arise.

== Why Gradle?

Gradle makes building and running apps easy; it is great for both small and large projects.

Gradle is fast, highly configurable, and very concise (no XML needed).

Gradle makes few assumptions about what you’re trying to build or how to build it which makes it particularly flexible.

The unique advantage of Gradle Build Tool is its elegant and extensible declarative build language.

High performance::
* Gradle avoids unnecessary work by only running tasks that need to do work because inputs or outputs have changed.
* Gradle uses various caches to reuse outputs from previous builds.
* With a shared build cache, you can even reuse outputs from other machines.
JVM foundation::
* Gradle runs on the JVM. This is a bonus for users familiar with Java, since build logic can use the standard Java APIs.
* It also makes it easy to run Gradle on different platforms.
Conventions::
* Gradle makes common types of projects easy to build through conventions. Plugins set sensible defaults to keep build scripts minimal.
* But these conventions don't limit you: you can configure settings, add your own tasks, and make many other customizations in your builds.
Extensibility::
* Most builds have special requirements that require custom build logic.
* You can readily extend Gradle to provide your own build logic with custom tasks and plugins.
* Android builds add many new build concepts such as flavors and build types.
IDE support::
* Several major IDEs provide interaction with Gradle builds, including Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VSCode, and NetBeans.
* Gradle can also generate the solution files required to load a project into Visual Studio.
Insight::
* https://scans.gradle.com/[Build Scan™] provides extensive information about a build that you can use to identify issues.
* You can use Build Scans™ to identify problems with a build's performance and even share them for debugging help.

== User Manual

The Gradle Build Tool user manual is broken down into the following sections:

Quick Start :: Get up and running installing Gradle.
Running Gradle Builds :: Use Gradle Build Tool to build your project.
Authoring Gradle Builds :: Develop tasks and plugins to customize your build.
Authoring JVM Builds :: Use Gradle Build Tool with your Java project.
Working with Dependencies :: Add dependencies to your build.
Optimizing Build Times :: Use a cache to optimize your build.
Gradle on CI :: Gradle integration with popular continuous integration (CI) servers.

== Fundamentals

Users provide instructions to Gradle using either Kotlin or Groovy in a script to build a Project (your code).

The build script contains default Tasks and optional custom Tasks that define build steps.

If your Project build requires highly custom build steps, https://plugins.gradle.org/[Plugins] can be used to extend the capabilities of Gradle.

If your Project uses dependencies, they are managed by Gradle's Dependency Manager.

== Terminology

It's helpful to know the following terminology before you dive into the details of Gradle.

=== Projects

Projects are the things that Gradle builds.
Projects contain a build script, which is a file located in the project's root directory usually named `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`.

Builds scripts define tasks, dependencies, plugins, and other configuration for that project.
A single build can contain one or more projects and each project can contain their own subprojects.

=== Builds

A build is an execution of a collection of tasks in a Gradle project.
You run a build via the command line interface (CLI) or an IDE by specifying task selectors.
Gradle configures the build and selects the tasks to run.
Gradle runs the smallest complete set of tasks based on the requested tasks and their dependencies.

=== Build Phases

Gradle evaluates and executes build scripts in three *build phases* of the <<build_lifecycle#build_lifecycle,Build Lifecycle>>:

Initialization::
Sets up the environment for the build and determine which projects will take part in it.

Configuration::
Constructs and configures the task graph for the build. Determines which tasks need to run and in which order, based on the task the user wants to run.

Execution::
Runs the tasks selected at the end of the configuration phase.

=== Build Cache

Gradle provides a build caching feature that allows it to cache the results of previous builds and reuse them when building the project again.
This helps to further reduce build times and improve performance.

Gradle supports both local and remote caching.

=== Tasks

Tasks contain the logic for executing some work--compiling code, running tests or deploying software.
In most use cases, you'll use existing tasks.
Gradle provides tasks that implement many common build system needs, like the built-in Java `Test` task that can run tests.
Plugins provide even more types of tasks.

Tasks themselves consist of:

* *Actions*: pieces of work that do something, like copy files or compile source
* *Inputs*: values, files and directories that the actions use or operate on
* *Outputs*: files and directories that the actions modify or generate

=== Plugins

Plugins allow you to introduce new concepts into a build beyond tasks, files and dependency configurations.
For example, most language plugins add the concept of <<building_java_projects#sec:java_source_sets,source sets>> to a build.

Plugins provide a means of reusing logic and configuration across multiple projects.
With plugins, you can write a task once and use it in multiple builds.
Or you can store common configuration, like logging, dependencies, and version management, in one place.
This reduces duplication in build scripts.
Appropriately modeling build processes with plugins can greatly improve ease of use and efficiency.

=== Dependency Management

Gradle provides a powerful dependency management system that makes it easy to manage project dependencies and ensures that all dependencies are resolved and downloaded automatically (from private or public repositories).
