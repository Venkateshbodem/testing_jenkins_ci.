= Part 3: Understanding Dependencies and Dependency Management

Learn the basics of Project dependencies and Gradle's dependency management.

****
**In this section you will:**

- View dependencies in the project
- Use and analyze a Build Scan
- Update dependencies in the project
- Understand transitive dependencies
****

[[part3_begin]]
== Step 0. Before you Begin

1. You initialized your Java app in <<part1_gradle_init.adoc#part1_begin,part 1>>.
2. You ran several tasks in <<part2_gradle_tasks#part2_begin,part 2>>.

== Step 1. Understanding Project Dependencies
Gradle provides excellent support for dependency management and automation.

Let's take another look at our build script (the `gradle.build` file), specifically the following section:
[source]
----
repositories {
    // Use Maven Central for resolving dependencies.
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    // Use JUnit test framework.
    testImplementation("junit:junit:4.13.2")

    // This dependency is used by the application.
    implementation("com.google.guava:guava:31.1-jre")
}
----

Some key concepts in Gradle dependency management include:

Repositories :: The source of dependencies - `mavenCentral()` +
https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central[Maven Central] is a collection of jar files, plugins, and libraries provided by the Maven community.
Dependencies :: Dependencies declared via configuration types - `junit` and `guava` +
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/junit/junit[JUnit] is a unit testing framework and https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.guava/guava[Guava] is a suite of core and expanded libraries from Google.

Gradle needs specific information to find a dependency.
Let's look at `com.google.guava:guava:31.1-jre` and `junit:junit:4.13.2`; they are broken down as follows:

[cols="10h,30,40,20"]
|===
| |Description | com.google.guava:guava:31.1-jre | junit:junit:4.13.2

|Group
|identifier of an organization
|`com.google.guava`
|`junit`

|Name
|dependency identifier
|`guava`
|`junit`

|Version
|version # to import
|`31.1-jre`
|`4.13.2`
|===

== Step 2. Using Build Scan
To view dependencies in our app, run the build task with an optional `--scan` flag.

In the `tutorial` directory, enter the command below and follow the prompt to accept the terms:
[source]
----
$ ./gradlew build --scan

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 423ms
7 actionable tasks: 7 up-to-date

Publishing a build scan to scans.gradle.com requires accepting the Gradle Terms of Service defined at https://gradle.com/terms-of-service. Do you accept these terms? [yes, no] yes

Gradle Terms of Service accepted.

Publishing build scan...
https://gradle.com/s/link
----

A https://scans.gradle.com/[Build Scan] is a shareable and centralized record of a build and is available as a free service from Gradle.

Click the link provided in the prompt: `https://gradle.com/s/link`.

WARNING: You will have to accept the terms of service to use Build Scans.

You will need to activate the Build Scan by using your email:

image::tutorial/build-scan-prompt.png[]

You will receive the final link to the scan in your inbox which should look as follows:

image::tutorial/build-scan-results.png[]

Open the **Dependencies** tab in the menu and expand `compileClasspath`, `runtimeClasspath`, `testCompileClasspath`, and `testRuntimeClasspath`:

image::tutorial/build-scan-dependencies.png[]

As expected, we can see the declared dependencies `junit` and `guava` are used by Gradle to compile, run, and test the app.

== Step 3. Understanding Transitive Dependencies
Expand `com.google.guava:guava:31.1-jre` and `org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.9.1` in the window:

image::tutorial/build-scan-trans-dependencies.png[]

There are several dependencies under `junit` and `guava` which are called _transitive dependencies_.

Transitive dependencies are the dependencies `junit` and `guava` need to work.
A _transitive dependency_ is a dependency of a dependency.

For example, the `com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:3.0.2` transitive dependency comes from the `com.google.guava:guava:31.1-jre` dependency.

== Step 4. Viewing Project Dependencies
You can also view your dependency tree in the terminal using the `./gradlew :app:dependencies` command:
[source]
----
$ ./gradlew :app:dependencies

> Task :app:dependencies

------------------------------------------------------------
Project ':app'
------------------------------------------------------------

annotationProcessor - Annotation processors and their dependencies for source set 'main'.
No dependencies

compileClasspath - Compile classpath for source set 'main'.
\--- com.google.guava:guava:31.1-jre
+--- com.google.guava:failureaccess:1.0.1
+--- com.google.guava:listenablefuture:9999.0-empty-to-avoid-conflict-with-guava
+--- com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:3.0.2
+--- org.checkerframework:checker-qual:3.12.0
+--- com.google.errorprone:error_prone_annotations:2.11.0
\--- com.google.j2objc:j2objc-annotations:1.3

...
----

== Step 4. Updating Project Dependencies
Adding and changing dependencies is done in the build file.

Let's change the `junit` version and look at how this affects the dependency tree.

Change the `junit` dependency to the `gradle.build.kts` file to:
[source]
----
implementation("com.google.guava:guava:30.0-jre")
----

If you change the file using IntelliJ, don't forget to click the `sync` Gradle button:

image::tutorial/intellij-idea-dep-man.png[]

Run `./gradlew build --scan` and view the Build Scan results:

image::tutorial/build-scan-change.png[]

Run `./gradlew :app:dependencies` in the terminal to check the changes in the dependency tree:
[source]
----
compileClasspath - Compile classpath for source set 'main'.
\--- com.google.guava:guava:30.0-jre
     +--- com.google.guava:failureaccess:1.0.1
     +--- com.google.guava:listenablefuture:9999.0-empty-to-avoid-conflict-with-guava
     +--- com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:3.0.2
     +--- org.checkerframework:checker-qual:3.5.0
     +--- com.google.errorprone:error_prone_annotations:2.3.4
     \--- com.google.j2objc:j2objc-annotations:1.3

...
----

It is clear the `guava` dependency has been updated to version `30.0` and the transitive dependencies have changed as well.
