= Dependency Management

Software projects rarely work in isolation.
Projects often rely on reusable functionality from libraries.
Some projects organize unrelated functionality into separate parts of a modular system.

Dependency management is an automated technique for declaring, resolving, and using functionality required by a project.

== Dependency Management in Gradle

Gradle has built-in support for dependency management.

Let's explore the main concepts with the help of a theoretical but common project:

* This project builds Java source code.
* Some Java source files import classes from the link:https://github.com/google/guava[Google Guava] library.
* This project uses link:http://junit.org/junit5/[JUnit] for testing.

The `build.gradle` file might look as follows:

.Gradle build file with dependencies
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/introductionCoreDependencies/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/introductionCoreDependencies/groovy",files="build.gradle"]
====
<1> Define artifact sources for project
<2> Remote and local repositories for artifact locations (link:https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central[Maven] and link:https://maven.google.com/[Google] repositories)
<3> Define artifacts used by project
<4> Specific artifact name and version within a specific scope (Guava 31.1-jre for implementation and JUnit 4.13.2 for testImplementation)

As we can see, this theoretical project uses Guava and JUnit as _dependencies_.

Gradle fetches dependencies from the specified _repositories_, in this case, link:https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central[Maven] and link:https://maven.google.com/[Google].
You can <<declaring_repositories.adoc#declaring-repositories,declare repositories>> to tell Gradle where to fetch dependencies locally or remotely.

Repositories offer dependencies in multiple formats.
For information about the formats supported by Gradle, see <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sec:dependency-types,dependency types>>.

A build engineer can <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#declaring-dependencies,declare dependencies>> for different scopes.
In the example project, the JUnit was declared only for the `testImplementation` scope which is used only when testing and not at runtime.
As such, one scope is used to compile source code and another to execute tests.
Gradle calls the <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sec:what-are-dependency-configurations,scope of a dependency>> a _configuration_.

During a build, Gradle locates the dependencies needed for the requested tasks.
The dependencies might need to be downloaded from a remote repository, retrieved from a local directory, or (in a multi-project setting) built from another project.
This process is called _dependency resolution_.
For more information, see <<dependency_resolution.adoc#sec:how-gradle-downloads-deps,How Gradle downloads dependencies>>.

Gradle then <<dependency_resolution.adoc#sec:dependency_cache,stores resolved dependencies in a local cache>> called the _dependency cache_.
Subsequent builds use the cache to avoid unnecessary network calls and speed up the build process.

Metadata describes dependencies.
Some examples of metadata include:

* coordinates for finding the dependency in a repository
* information about the project that created the dependency
* the authors of the dependency
* other dependencies required for a dependency to work properly, known as _transitive dependencies_

You can <<dependency_constraints.adoc#dependency-constraints,customize Gradle's handling of transitive dependencies>> based on the requirements of a project.

Projects with hundreds of declared dependencies can be difficult to debug.
Gradle provides tools to visualize and analyze a project's dependency graph (i.e. dependency tree).
You can use a link:https://scans.gradle.com/get-started[Build Scan(TM)] or <<viewing_debugging_dependencies.adoc#viewing-debugging-dependencies,built-in tasks>>.
