== Declaring component capabilities

=== Capabilities as first-level concept

Components provide a number of features which are often orthogonal to the software architecture used to provide those features.
For example, a library may include several features in a single artifact.
However, such a library would be published at single GAV (group, artifact and version) coordinates.
This means that, at single coordinates, potentially co-exist different "features" of a component.

With Gradle it becomes interesting to explicitly declare what features a component provides.
For this, Gradle provides the concept of <<controlling_transitive_dependencies.adoc#sec:capabilities,capability>>.

A feature is often built by combining different _capabilities_.

In an ideal world, components shouldn't declare dependencies on explicit GAVs, but rather express their requirements in terms of capabilities:

- "give me a component which provides logging"
- "give me a scripting engine"
- "give me a scripting engine that supports Groovy"

By modeling _capabilities_, the dependency management engine can be smarter and tell you whenever you have _incompatible capabilities_ in a dependency graph, or ask you to choose whenever different modules in a graph provide the same _capability_.

=== Declaring capabilities for external modules

It's worth noting that Gradle supports declaring capabilities for components you build, but also for external components in case they didn't.

For example, if your build file contains the following dependencies:

.A build file with an implicit conflict of logging frameworks
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/managingTransitiveDependencies/declaringCapabilities/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=dependencies]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/managingTransitiveDependencies/declaringCapabilities/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=dependencies]"]
====

As is, it's pretty hard to figure out that you will end up with two logging frameworks on the classpath.
In fact, `zookeeper` will bring in `log4j`, where what we want to use is `log4j-over-slf4j`.
We can preemptively detect the conflict by adding a rule which will declare that both logging frameworks provide the same capability:

.A build file with an implicit conflict of logging frameworks
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/managingTransitiveDependencies/declaringCapabilities/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=declare_capability]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/managingTransitiveDependencies/declaringCapabilities/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=declare_capability]"]
====

By adding this rule, we will make sure that Gradle _will_ detect conflicts and properly fail:

```
Cannot choose between log4j:log4j:1.2.16 and org.slf4j:log4j-over-slf4j:1.7.10 because they provide the same capability: org.slf4j:slf4j-capability:1.0
```

See the <<controlling_transitive_dependencies.adoc#sec:capabilities, capabilities section of the documentation>> to figure out how to fix capability conflicts.

=== Declaring additional capabilities for a local component

All components have an _implicit capability_ corresponding to the same GAV coordinates as the component.
This is convenient whenever a library published at different GAV coordinates is an _alternate implementation_ of the same API.
However, it is also possible to declare additional _explicit capabilities_ for a component:

.Declaring capabilities of a component
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/outgoingCapabilities/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=declare-outgoing-capabilities]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/outgoingCapabilities/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=declare-outgoing-capabilities]"]
====

Capabilities must be attached to _outgoing configurations_, which are <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sub:resolvable-consumable-configs,consumable configurations>> of a component.

This example shows that we declare two capabilities:

1. `com.acme:my-library:1.0`, which corresponds to the _implicit capability_ of the library
2. `com.other:module:1.1`, which corresponds to another capability of this library

It's worth noting we need to do 1. because as soon as you start declaring _explicit_ capabilities, then _all_ capabilities need to be declared, including the _implicit_ one.

The second capability can be specific to this library, or it can correspond to a capability provided by an external component.
In that case, if `com.other:module` appears in the same dependency graph, the build will fail and consumers <<controlling_transitive_dependencies.adoc#selecting-between-candidates,will have to choose what module to use>>.

Capabilities are published to Gradle Module Metadata.
However, they have _no equivalent_ in POM or Ivy metadata files.
As a consequence, when publishing such a component, Gradle will warn you that this feature is only for Gradle consumers:

```
Maven publication 'maven' contains dependencies that cannot be represented in a published pom file.
  - Declares capability com.acme:my-library:1.0
  - Declares capability com.other:module:1.1
```
