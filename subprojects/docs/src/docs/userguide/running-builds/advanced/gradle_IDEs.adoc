= Gradle in IDEs

All major IDEs support Gradle including Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, and NetBeans.

== Android Studio

The Android build system compiles app resources and source code and packages them into APKs or Android App Bundles that you can test, deploy, sign, and distribute.

Android Studio uses Gradle to automate and manage the build process while letting you define flexible, custom build configurations.
