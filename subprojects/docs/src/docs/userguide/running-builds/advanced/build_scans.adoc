= Build Scans

A build scan is a representation of data captured as you run your build.

== What are Build Scans?
Gradle captures your build data and sends it to the link:https://scans.gradle.com/[Build Scan Service].
The service then transforms the data into information you can use and share with others.

The information that scans provide can be a big help when troubleshooting, collaborating on, or optimizing the performance of your builds.

For example, with a build scan, itâ€™s no longer necessary to copy and paste error messages or include all the details about your environment each time you want to ask a question on Stack Overflow, Slack, or the Gradle Forum.
Instead, just copy the link to your latest build scan.

== How do I enable Build Scans?

To enable build scans on a gradle command, add `--scan` to the command line option:

[source]
----
 ./gradlew stageDocs --scans
----

You may be prompted to agree to the terms in order to use Gradle's build scans.
