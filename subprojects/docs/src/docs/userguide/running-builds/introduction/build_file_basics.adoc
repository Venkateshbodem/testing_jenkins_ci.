[[build_file_basics]]
= Build File Basics

Every project has a build script that details build configuration, tasks, and plugins.

image::gradle-basic-4.png[]

Every Gradle build comprises one or more projects; a root project and subprojects.
Each one has a _build script_.

For single-project builds, the build file contains dependencies and repository information for the build and the project.

For multi-project builds, each subproject has its own build file, and each subproject will be evaluated by executing its build file.

In the build file, two types of dependencies can be added:

1. The libraries and/or plugins on which Gradle and the build script depend.
2. The libraries on which the project sources depend.

[[sec:build_script]]
== Build scripts

The build script is either a `build.gradle` file written in Groovy or a `build.gradle.kts` file written in Kotlin.

The link:{groovyDslPath}/index.html[Groovy DSL^] and the link:{kotlinDslPath}/index.html[Kotlin DSL^] are the only accepted languages for Gradle scripts.

Let's take a look at an example and break it down:

====

=== 1. Add plugins
Plugins are bundled tasks used to extend Gradle.

Adding a plugin to a build is called _applying_ a plugin.

[source]
----
plugins {
    id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm") version "1.9.0"
}
----

The Kotlin gradle plugin, version 1.9.0, has been applied to the project so that source code written in Kotlin can be used.

=== 2. Add dependency location
A project generally has several dependencies it needs to do its work.
Many of the dependencies will be used by the source code.

In the example, the link:https://mvnrepository.com/[Maven Central^] repository has been added as the location for all the binaries that Gradle will need to download to build the project.

[source]
----
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
----

In this example, the Kotlin JVM Plugin, `org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm`, will be downloaded by Gradle from the link:https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm/org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm.gradle.plugin[Maven Central Repository].

=== 3. Add dependencies
Dependencies are grouped in configurations and can be retrieved and uploaded from repositories.

In the example, a list of dependencies based on configurations (how/when/where Gradle will use it) is added, including the `junit` testing framework, which is used to test the Java source code.

[source]
----
dependencies {
    testImplementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-test-junit5")
    testImplementation("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.9.3")
    testRuntimeOnly("org.junit.platform:junit-platform-launcher")
    implementation("com.google.guava:guava:32.1.1-jre")
}
----

In this example, the source code in the project will import the Google `guava` library which will also be retrieved from the link:https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.guava/guava[Maven Central Repository] by Gradle.

=== 4. Use convention properties
A plugin adds tasks to a project.
It also adds properties and methods to a project.

In the example, the `application` plugin has a method that can declare the main class of a Java application, which is required to compile and run the code.

[source]
----
application {
    mainClass.set("main")
}
----

=== 5. Register or configure tasks
Tasks perform some basic work, such as compiling classes, running unit tests, or zipping up a WAR file.

Tasks either come from plugins or the build script itself.

In the example, the build script configures all test-related tasks to use the `JUnit` platform.

[source]
----
tasks.named<Test>("test") {
    useJUnitPlatform()
}
----
