[[gradle]]
= Gradle Basics

Many developers will interact with Gradle for the first time using an existing project.

The presence of the `gradlew` and `gradle.bat` file in the root directory of a project is a clear indicator that Gradle is used.

A Gradle project will look similar to the following:

[source]
----
project
├── gradle                              // <1>
│   ├── libs.versions.toml              // <2>
│   └── wrapper
│       ├── gradle-wrapper.jar
│       └── gradle-wrapper.properties
├── gradlew                             // <3>
├── gradlew.bat                         // <3>
├── settings.gradle(.kts)               // <4>
├── subproject-a
│   ├── build.gradle(.kts)              // <5>
│   └── src                             // <6>
└── subproject-b
    ├── build.gradle(.kts)              // <5>
    └── logic                           // <6>
----
<1> Gradle wrapper files
<2> Gradle version catalog for dependency management
<3> Gradle wrapper scripts
<4> Gradle settings file to define a root project name and subprojects
<5> Gradle build scripts of the two subprojects - `subproject-a` and `subproject-b`
<6> Source code and/or additional files for the projects

== Basic Gradle concepts

Gradle builds Android, Groovy, Scala, Kotlin, or Java (JVM) projects from information contained in build scripts and a settings file.

=== Projects

A Gradle project includes *one root project* and *any number of subprojects* detailed in the settings file, `settings.gradle` or `settings.gradle.kts`.

=== Build Scripts

*Each (sub)project contains a build script*.
A build script is either a `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` file and details build steps to Gradle using the Groovy or Kotlin DSL respectively.

=== Tasks

*Each (sub)project contains one or more tasks.*
Tasks are either defined inside a build script or a plugin and detail actions for Gradle to take.

=== Plugins

Plugins are used to extend Gradle's capability and are essentially a *bundle of useful tasks*.

== Invoking Gradle

=== Command line

Gradle can be invoked in the command line once <<installation.adoc#installation, installed>>.
For example:

[source]
----
$ gradle build
----

=== Gradle Wrapper

The Wrapper is a script that invokes a declared version of Gradle and is *the recommended way to execute a Gradle build*.
It is found in the project root directory as a `gradlew` or `gradle.bat` file:

[source]
----
$ gradlew build     // Linux or OSX
$ gradle.bat build  // Windows
----

=== IDE

Gradle is built-in to many IDEs including Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, and NetBeans.

Gradle is automatically invoked when you build, clean, or run your app in the IDE.

It is recommended that you consult the manual for the IDE of your choice to learn more about how Gradle is used.
