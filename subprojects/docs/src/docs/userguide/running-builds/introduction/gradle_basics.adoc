= Gradle Basics

Gradle *automates building, testing, and deployment of software* from information contained in *build scripts*.

== Gradle core concepts

=== Projects

A Gradle project is a piece of software that can be built, such an application or a library.

Single project builds include a single project called the *root project*.

Multi-project builds include *one root project* and *any number of subprojects* detailed in a settings file.

=== Build Scripts

*Each project can include a build script* that details to Gradle what steps to take in order to build the project.

=== Tasks

*Each project contains one or more tasks* defined inside a build script or a plugin that details actions to Gradle.
Tasks are a basic unit of work.

=== Plugins

Plugins are used to *extend Gradle's capability* and are essentially a *bundle of tasks*.

== Gradle project structure

Many developers will interact with Gradle for the first time through an existing project.

The presence of the `gradlew` and `gradle.bat` files in the root directory of a project is a clear indicator that Gradle is used.

A Gradle project will look similar to the following:

[source]
----
project
├── gradle                              // <1>
│   ├── libs.versions.toml              // <2>
│   └── wrapper
│       ├── gradle-wrapper.jar
│       └── gradle-wrapper.properties
├── gradlew                             // <3>
├── gradlew.bat                         // <3>
├── settings.gradle(.kts)               // <4>
├── subproject-a
│   ├── build.gradle(.kts)              // <5>
│   └── src                             // <6>
└── subproject-b
    ├── build.gradle(.kts)              // <5>
    └── logic                           // <6>
----
<1> Gradle wrapper files
<2> Gradle version catalog for dependency management
<3> Gradle wrapper scripts
<4> Gradle settings file to define a root project name and subprojects
<5> Gradle build scripts of the two subprojects - `subproject-a` and `subproject-b`
<6> Source code and/or additional files for the projects

== Invoking Gradle

=== Command line

Gradle can be invoked in the command line once <<installation.adoc#installation, installed>>.
For example:

[source]
----
$ gradle build
----

=== Gradle Wrapper

The Wrapper is a script that invokes a declared version of Gradle and is *the recommended way to execute a Gradle build*.
It is found in the project root directory as a `gradlew` or `gradle.bat` file:

[source]
----
$ gradlew build     // Linux or OSX
$ gradle.bat build  // Windows
----

=== IDE

Gradle is <<gradle_ides.adoc#gradle_ides,built-in to many IDEs>> including Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, and NetBeans.

Gradle can be automatically invoked when you build, clean, or run your app in the IDE.

It is recommended that you consult the manual for the IDE of your choice to learn more about how Gradle can be used and configured.
