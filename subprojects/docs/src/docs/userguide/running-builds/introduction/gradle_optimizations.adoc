Gradle uses two main features to reduce build time, *incremental builds* and *caching*.

== Incremental builds

An *incremental build* is a build that avoids running tasks whose inputs have not changed since the previous build, making the execution of such tasks unnecessary.

For incremental builds to work, tasks must define their inputs and outputs.
Gradle will determine whether the input or outputs have changed at build time.
If they have changed, Gradle will execute the task.
Otherwise, it will skip execution.

Incremental builds are always enabled so the only way to see it in action is to turn on _verbose mode_.
With verbose mode, each task state is labeled during a build:

[source]
----
$ ./gradlew compileJava

> Task :buildSrc:generateExternalPluginSpecBuilders UP-TO-DATE
> Task :buildSrc:extractPrecompiledScriptPluginPlugins UP-TO-DATE
> Task :buildSrc:compilePluginsBlocks UP-TO-DATE
> Task :buildSrc:generatePrecompiledScriptPluginAccessors UP-TO-DATE
> Task :buildSrc:generateScriptPluginAdapters UP-TO-DATE
> Task :buildSrc:compileKotlin UP-TO-DATE
> Task :buildSrc:compileJava NO-SOURCE
> Task :buildSrc:compileGroovy NO-SOURCE
> Task :buildSrc:pluginDescriptors UP-TO-DATE
> Task :buildSrc:processResources UP-TO-DATE
> Task :buildSrc:classes UP-TO-DATE
> Task :buildSrc:jar UP-TO-DATE
> Task :list:compileJava UP-TO-DATE
> Task :utilities:compileJava UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:compileJava UP-TO-DATE

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 374ms
12 actionable tasks: 12 up-to-date
----

When you run a task that has been previously executed and hasn't changed, then `UP-TO-DATE` is printed next to the task.

=== Turn on verbose mode
To view the state of a task, add `org.gradle.console=verbose` to your `gradle.properties` file:

[source]
----
org.gradle.console=verbose
----

== Build caching

Incremental Builds are a great optimization that helps avoid work already done.
If a developer continuously changes a single file, there is likely no need to rebuild all the other files in the project.

However, what happens when the same developer switches to a new branch created last week?
The files are rebuilt, even though the developer is building something that has been built before.

This is where a *build cache* is helpful.

The build cache stores previous build results and restores them when needed.
It prevents the redundant work and cost of regenerating time-consuming and expensive processes.

When the build cache has been used to repopulate the local directory, the tasks are marked as `FROM-CACHE`:

[source]
----
$ ./gradlew compileJava

> Task :buildSrc:generateExternalPluginSpecBuilders UP-TO-DATE
> Task :buildSrc:extractPrecompiledScriptPluginPlugins UP-TO-DATE
> Task :buildSrc:compilePluginsBlocks UP-TO-DATE
> Task :buildSrc:generatePrecompiledScriptPluginAccessors UP-TO-DATE
> Task :buildSrc:generateScriptPluginAdapters UP-TO-DATE
> Task :buildSrc:compileKotlin UP-TO-DATE
> Task :buildSrc:compileJava NO-SOURCE
> Task :buildSrc:compileGroovy NO-SOURCE
> Task :buildSrc:pluginDescriptors UP-TO-DATE
> Task :buildSrc:processResources UP-TO-DATE
> Task :buildSrc:classes UP-TO-DATE
> Task :buildSrc:jar UP-TO-DATE
> Task :list:compileJava FROM-CACHE
> Task :utilities:compileJava FROM-CACHE
> Task :app:compileJava FROM-CACHE

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 364ms
12 actionable tasks: 3 from cache, 9 up-to-date
----

Once the local directory has been repopulated, the next execution will mark tasks as `UP-TO-DATE` and not `FROM-CACHE`.

The build cache allows you to share and reuse unchanged build and test outputs across teams.
This speeds up local and CI builds since cycles are not wasted re-building components that are unaffected by new code changes.

=== Turn on local build cache
Add `org.gradle.caching=true` to the `gradle.properties` file:

[source]
----
org.gradle.caching=true
----

=== Turn off local build cache
Add `org.gradle.caching=false` to the `gradle.properties` file:

[source]
----
org.gradle.caching=false
----

=== Clear local build cache
Run the `cleanBuildCache` task:

[source]
----
./gradlew cleanBuildCache
----

=== Remote build cache
In addition to the local build cache on a developer's machine, Gradle can use a remote build cache.

The idea of a remote cache is to share commonly built task outputs across remote builds to improve build times.

When both remote and local caches are enabled, the build output is first checked in the local cache.
If the output isn't in the local cache, it will be downloaded from the remote cache and stored in the local cache.

=== Configuration cache
The configuration cache is a newer Gradle optimization.

Unlike the build cache, which caches outputs produced by the build, the configuration cache captures and saves the state of the configuration phase.

The configuration cache improves build performance by caching the result of the configuration phase and reusing this for subsequent builds.
