= Gradle Wrapper Basics

The **recommended way to execute any Gradle build** is with the Gradle Wrapper.

The Wrapper script invokes a declared version of Gradle, downloading it beforehand if necessary.
As a result, developers can get up and running with a Gradle project quickly.

The Wrapper is available as a `gradlew` or `gradle.bat` file.

The Wrapper provides the following benefits:

- Standardizes a project on a given Gradle version.
- Provisions the same Gradle version for different users.
- Provisions the Gradle version for different execution environments (IDEs, CI servers...).

== Using the Gradle Wrapper

It is always recommended to execute a build with the Wrapper to ensure a reliable, controlled, and standardized execution of the build.

Depending on the operating system, you run `gradlew` or `gradlew.bat` instead of the `gradle` command.

Typical Gradle invocation:

----
$ gradle build
----

To run the Wrapper on a Linux or OSX machine:

----
$ ./gradlew build
----

To run the Wrapper on a Windows machine:

----
$ gradlew.bat build
----

The following console output demonstrates the use of the Wrapper on a Windows machine for a Java-based project:

----
$ gradlew.bat build
