[[task_basics]]
= Task Basics

The work that Gradle can do on a project is defined by one or more _tasks_.

image::gradle-basic-5.png[]

A task represents some atomic piece of work that a build performs.
This might be compiling some classes, creating a JAR, generating Javadoc, or publishing some archives to a repository.

You run a Gradle `build` task using the `gradle` command or by invoking the Gradle Wrapper (`./gradlew' or `gradle.bat`) in your project directory:

[source]
----
$ ./gradlew build
----

== Available tasks
All available tasks in your project come from Gradle plugins and build scripts.

You can list all the available tasks in the project by running the following command in the terminal:

[source]
----
$ ./gradlew tasks
----

[source]
----
Application tasks
-----------------
run - Runs this project as a JVM application

Build tasks
-----------
assemble - Assembles the outputs of this project.
build - Assembles and tests this project.

...

Documentation tasks
-------------------
javadoc - Generates Javadoc API documentation for the main source code.

...

Other tasks
-----------
compileJava - Compiles main Java source.

[[sec:hello_world]]
== Hello world task

Let's take a look at a simple "Hello World" task in a build script:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/hello/kotlin", files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/hello/groovy", files="build.gradle[]"]
====

You can execute the build script with `./gradlew -q hello`:

====
----
$ ./gradlew -q hello
include::{snippetsPath}/tutorial/hello/tests/hello.out[]
----
====

[TIP]
====
The `-q` option suppresses Gradle's log messages so that only the output of the tasks is shown.
====

In the example, the build script registers a single task called `hello` and adds an action to it.

When you run `./gradlew hello`, Gradle executes the `hello` task, which executes the action you've provided.
The action is simply a block containing some code to execute: `println("Hello world!")`.

== Task types

There are two types of tasks:

1. *Actionable tasks* have some action(s) attached to do work in your build: `compileJava`.
2. *Lifecycle tasks* are workflow tasks with no actions attached: `assemble`, `build`.

== Built-in tasks

Gradle provides many _built-in_ task types for common actions such as copying or deleting files.

This example task copies `*.war` files from the `source` directory to the `target` directory using the built-in `Copy` task type:

[source]
----
tasks.register("copyTask",Copy) {
    from("source")
    into("target")
    include("*.war")
}
----

This task is executed using the command `./gradlew :app:copyTask`.

Popular built-in task types include:

- **Copy** - `Copy` is useful to copy files around.
- **Delete** -  `Delete` is useful to delete files and directories.
- **Exec** - `Exec` is useful to execute arbitrary O/S commands.
- **Zip** - `Zip` is useful for bundling files.

Many more are included in the link:{kotlinDslPath}/gradle/org.gradle.api.tasks/-delete/index.html[DSL documentation].
