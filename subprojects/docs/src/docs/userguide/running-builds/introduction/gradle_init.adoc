[[gradle_init]]
= Gradle Init

Gradle comes with a built-in task called `init` that initializes a new Gradle project.

The `init` task uses the built-in `wrapper` task to create a Gradle wrapper script, `gradlew` and `gradle.bat`.

The task must be run in an empty folder.

== The init task

Run the `init` task using the following command in a terminal:

----
$ gradle init
----

== Task options

The task prompts the user for information about the project:

----
$ gradle init

Select type of project to generate:
  1: basic
  2: application
  3: library
  4: Gradle plugin
Enter selection (default: basic) [1..4]

Select build script DSL:
  1: Groovy
  2: Kotlin
Enter selection (default: Kotlin) [1..2]

Project name (default: project):

Generate build using new APIs and behavior (some features may change in the next minor release)? (default: no) [yes, no]
----

There are 4 types of project:

1. *Basic* - a basic project with one settings file and one build file.
2. *Application* - a C++, Groovy, Java, Kotlin, Scala or Swift project with an `app` folder.
3. *Library* - a library such as an API with a `lib` folder.
4. *Gradle Plugin* - a Gradle plugin with a `plugin` folder.

You may be asked about the language your project is based on such as C++, Scala, Java or Kotlin if you choose option 2, 3, or 4 for the type of project.

You may also be asked for your target Java version.

You will be asked if your scripts are written in Groovy or Kotlin.
Kotlin is the recommended default.
Your choice determines which DSL you will use to configure Gradle and this can be changed at any time.

If you choose `yes` for `Generate build using new APIs and behavior?`, Gradle will setup the build to use Test Suites.

== Task results

The `init` task generates the new basic project with the following structure:
