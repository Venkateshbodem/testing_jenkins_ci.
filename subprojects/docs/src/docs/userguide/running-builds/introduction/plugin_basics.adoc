Plugins are used to extend build capability and customize Gradle.

Using plugins is the **primary mechanism for organizing build logic**.

Plugin authors can either keep their plugins private or distribute them to the public. As such, plugins are distributed three ways:

1. **Core plugins** - Gradle develops and maintains a set of <<plugin_reference#plugin_reference,Core Plugins>>.
2. **Community plugins** - Gradle's community shares plugins via the https://plugins.gradle.org[Gradle Plugin Portal].
3. **Custom plugins** - Gradle enables user to create custom plugins using link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.javadoc.Javadoc.html[APIs].
