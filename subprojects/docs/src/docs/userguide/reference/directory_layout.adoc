= The Directories and Files Gradle Uses

Gradle uses two main directories to perform and manage its work: the <<#dir:gradle_user_home>> and the <<#dir:project_root>>.
The following two sections describe what is stored in each of them and how transient files and directories are cleaned up.


[[dir:gradle_user_home]]
== Gradle user home directory

The Gradle user home directory (`<home directory of the current user>/.gradle` by default) is used to store global configuration properties and initialization scripts as well as caches and log files.
It is roughly structured as follows:

[listing]
----
├── caches // <1>
│   ├── 4.8 // <2>
│   ├── 4.9 // <2>
│   ├── ⋮
│   ├── jars-3 // <3>

<7> Distributions downloaded by the <<gradle_wrapper.adoc#gradle_wrapper,Gradle Wrapper>>
<8> Global <<build_environment.adoc#sec:gradle_configuration_properties,Gradle configuration properties>>

[[dir:gradle_user_home:cache_cleanup]]
=== Cleanup of caches and distributions

Gradle automatically cleans its user home directory.
By default, the cleanup runs in the background when the Gradle daemon is stopped or shuts down.
If using `--no-daemon`, it runs in the foreground after the build session with a visual progress indicator.

The following cleanup strategies are applied periodically (by default, once every 24 hours):

- Version-specific caches in `caches/<gradle-version>/` are checked for whether they are still in use.  If not, directories for release versions are deleted after 30 days of inactivity, snapshot versions after 7 days of inactivity.
- Shared caches in `caches/` (e.g. `jars-*`) are checked for whether they are still in use.  If there's no Gradle version that still uses them, they are deleted.
- Files in shared caches used by the current Gradle version in `caches/` (e.g. `jars-3` or `modules-2`) are checked for when they were last accessed.  Depending on whether the file can be recreated locally or would have to be downloaded from a remote repository again, it will be deleted after 7 or 30 days of not being accessed, respectively.
- Gradle distributions in `wrapper/dists/` are checked for whether they are still in use, i.e. whether there's a corresponding version-specific cache directory.  Unused distributions are deleted.

[[dir:gradle_user_home:configure_cache_cleanup]]
==== Configuring cleanup of caches and distributions

The retention periods of the various caches can be configured.  Caches are classified into four categories:

- *Released wrapper distributions:* Distributions and related version-specific caches that correspond to released versions (e.g. `4.6.2` or `8.0`).  Default retention for unused versions is 30 days.
- *Snapshot wrapper distributions:* Distributions and related version-specific caches that correspond to snapshot versions (e.g. `7.6-20221130141522+0000`).  Default retention for unused versions is 7 days.
- *Downloaded resources:* Shared caches that are downloaded from a remote repository (e.g. cached dependencies).  Default retention for unused resources is 30 days.
- *Created resources:* Shared caches that are created by Gradle during the course of a build (e.g. artifact transforms).  Default retention for unused resources is 7 days.

The retention period for each category can be configured independently via an init script in Gradle User Home:

.Configuring cache retention
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/initScripts/cacheRetention/groovy",files="gradleUserHome/init.d/cache-settings.gradle"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/initScripts/cacheRetention/kotlin",files="gradleUserHome/init.d/cache-settings.gradle.kts"]
====

The frequency at which cache cleanup is invoked is also configurable.  There are three possible settings:

- *DEFAULT:* Cleanup is performed periodically in the background (currently once every 24 hours).
- *DISABLED:* Never cleanup Gradle user home.  This is useful in cases where Gradle user home is ephemeral or it's desirable to delay cleanup until an explicit point in the future.
- *ALWAYS:* Cleanup is performed at the end of each build session.  This is useful in cases where it's desirable to ensure that cleanup has occurred before proceeding.

.Disabling cache cleanup
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/initScripts/disableCacheCleanup/groovy",files="gradleUserHome/init.d/cache-settings.gradle"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/initScripts/disableCacheCleanup/kotlin",files="gradleUserHome/init.d/cache-settings.gradle.kts"]
====

[[dir:project_root]]
== Project root directory

The project root directory contains all source files that are part of your project.
In addition, it contains files and directories that are generated by Gradle such as `.gradle` and `build`.
While the former are usually checked in to source control, the latter are transient files used by Gradle to support features like incremental builds.
Overall, the anatomy of a typical project root directory looks roughly as follows:

[[dir:project_root:cache_cleanup]]
=== Project cache cleanup

From version 4.10 onwards, Gradle automatically cleans the project-specific cache directory.
After building the project, version-specific cache directories in `.gradle/<gradle-version>/` are checked periodically (at most every 24 hours) for whether they are still in use.
They are deleted if they haven't been used for 7 days.
