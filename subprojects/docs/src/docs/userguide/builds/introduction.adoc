= Introduction to Gradle Builds

You may know Gradle as the tool that helps you build Java or Android projects.
Perhaps you use Gradle through your IDE. Maybe you've dabbled in the CLI.
You've probably made small edits to your Gradle build files: squashing bugs, or even integrating frameworks and libraries.
This introduction will help you understand the fundamentals of Gradle.
With this knowledge, you can take on bigger tasks, like speeding up your Gradle builds,
running style checks, and optimizing your test suites.
