This sample shows how to create a plugin with tasks that have dependency resolution results as inputs.
The plugin is packaged via an included build and is demonstrated on a multi-project build for a Java application.

====
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="settings.gradle[tag=includes];list/build.gradle[];utilities/build.gradle[];build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="settings.gradle.kts[tag=includes];list/build.gradle.kts[];utilities/build.gradle.kts[];build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

To execute the sample tasks:

> ./gradlew -q listResolvedArtifactIdentifiers
include::{samplesPath}/writing-tasks/tasks-with-dependency-resolution-result-inputs/tests/listResolvedArtifactIdentifiers.out[]
